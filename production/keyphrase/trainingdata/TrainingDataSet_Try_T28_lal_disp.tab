edge of the window	0.0	0.0	7.99588477366	10.0	0.0	False
acts like a clipper	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
right considering each edge	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
acts as a clipper	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False

balanced this is height	0.0	0.0	0.0	4.0	0.0	False
balanced so the height	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
imbalanced because original height	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
two then that means	0.0	0.0	0.0	4.0	0.0	False

lets repeat the argument	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
assuming that the insertion	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
right it could happen	0.0	0.0	0.0	4.0	0.0	False
height of this guy	0.0	0.0	0.0	4.0	0.0	False
insertion the new height	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
balanced then that means	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
height has not increased	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
means y is height	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
keys is the middle	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False

difference is this balanced	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
imbalanced here and height	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
right so this rotation	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
rotation what other rotation	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
left they will remain	0.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	0.0	False
