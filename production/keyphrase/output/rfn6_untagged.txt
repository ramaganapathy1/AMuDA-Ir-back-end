wide range of automatic identification  auto-id  systems including magnetic stripes  optical character recognition  ocr   barcodes  biometrics  contact memory buttons  and smart cards have been around for many years and have helped in increasing the efficiency as well as efficacy of different business processes  each of these technologies has their pros and cons and has specific target-applications for which they have their niche markets  although ocr systems allow simultaneous manual and auto-identification  the prohibitive cost of the readers prevented the widespread use of the technology in applications other than banking and production  1   while barcodes have proved to be a cost-effective way for managing inventory  they have certain inherent disadvantages such as limited information-storing capacity ; a strict line of sight requirement between the scanner and the barcode  which effectively prevents multiple barcodes to be processed simultaneously ; limited data redundancy and error correction ; and a lack of inbuilt data-security standards in various symbologies  biometrics  such as fingerprinting  retina scans  iris scans  and voice recognition are all considered to be strong identification solutions in automatic access control but some people find these technologies obtrusive thereby limiting their exposure  contact memory buttons are robust auto-ids that are capable of withstanding adverse environments that overcome a number of barcode system limitations and support features such as high data storage capacity  up to 8 mb   the ability to write data multiple times  and data security using encryption  however  despite these advantages  the requirement for conmanuscript received november 15  2011 ; accepted november 25  2011

security issues tact to take place between the reader and the button thus making them suitable for only limited applications ; coupled with the fact that these are proprietary systems  has severely restricted their market share  2   smart card  and derivatives such as memory card or microprocessor card   solutions use standard credit-card sized plastic cards with an integral data storage system that is designed to make financial transactions secure as well as faster  but they have to deal with the high cost of maintenance of their readers  3   the globalization of businesses  the rise of e-commerce  and the need for more efficient supply chain management propelled the industry to invent a new generation contactless auto-id system called radio frequency identification  rfid   which sought to overcome these limitations and to reduce human intervention in inventory-management and other industrial processes by drastically improving both the speed as well as accuracy of data collection and dissemination  rfid systems rely on radio frequency to transmit a tag-specific unique serial number to a reader or interrogator  the earliest predecessor of the rfid concept is believed to be a soviet spy gadget that retransmitted incident radio waves with audio information  one of the earliest applications of rf transponders was the friend-or-foe  iff  identification  friend or foe  aircraft identification system that was used by the royal air force during world war ii to distinguish between enemy and allied aircraft  4   in the us  rfids have been used since the 1960s to manage nuclear and hazardous material  the modulated backscatter rfid tags  as demonstrated at the los alamos national laboratory in 1973  are widely used today  particularly in the uhf and microwave spectrum  popular applications of rfid  apart from inventory management throughout the entire supply chain  include patient tracking  toll-gate payment systems  high value asset tracking for defense applications  animal tracking  casino management  automobile security  financial transaction systems  and the tracking of pharmaceuticals etc  different tag variables  such as the power source  the class  and generation  as well as different system frequencies  standards  and protocols affect various performance parameters such as data transmission range  reading distance  life span  the amount of data  and security issues  these different variables are described in greater detail in the following sections  2 rfid environment depending on the application that is used  the actual characteristics of the different components will vary greatly  however  the primary components of a typical rfid infrastructure include   a  a transponder or tag with a unique identifier that facilitates auto-identification of any object to which the tag is attached   b  a reader or interrogator that manages the radio frequency communication with the tags   c  a middleware or reader interface layer  which is essentially a type of software that acts as an interface between the basic rfid hardware components  and the software application tasked with data collection related to tag-events  since rf communication requires the transmission and / or reception of data  the reader  as well as the tag  are in essence rf transceivers that are equipped with suitable antennas  the reader acts as a transmitter in the reader-to-tag communication  which is referred to as the for 562 amit grover and hal berghel fig  1 rfid infrastructure components ward link ; and as a receiver in the tag-to-reader communication is referred to as the back link  5   the tag communicates by acting in the opposite mode than that of the reader in each of the link directions  apart from these fundamental components  certain rfid systems are also equipped with an optional infrared-capable transmitter known as a signpost  which solves the problem of rf signal bleeding and provides more precise location identification  6   real world rfid implementations indicate substantial variations in the type or form of the fundamental components used  based on application-specific requirements  these variations are described in the following sections in greater detail  3 rfid transponders a typical rfid transponder consists of an integrated circuit and an antenna embedded in a plastic or mylar substrate  the ic is responsible for responding to the signals transmitted by the reader and replying with the tags unique identifier  and modulating and demodulating the radiofrequency signal  the actual communication is facilitated by the antenna that absorbs the incoming rf waves and utilizes the absorbed energy to activate the ic  different applications focus on different chip characteristics such as the memory capacity  the ability to alter the antennas impedance  the power conversion efficiency  and the ability to handle data collision  the antennas reflect the power back by using a process known as backscatter  unlike specular reflection  backscattering is a diffuse reflection  wherein an incident ray is reflected at multiple angles  of waves  particles  or signals due to scattering  deviation from a straight trajectory by one or more localized non-uniformities in the transmission medium  back to the direction they came from  the size and design characteristics of the antenna greatly affect the efficacy of the coupling between the transponder and the readers electromagnetic field  the bigger the size of the antenna  the greater is the range that the tag can support  coil shaped antennas are best suited for handing low frequency  lf  and high frequency  hf  radio communication  while traditional radio antennas are better suited for ultra high frequency  uhf  communication  7   since radio waves behave differently at different frequencies  their main characteristics are summarized in table 1  8   563 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues table 1 rfid frequency antenna relationship frequency field tag type antenna type lf near inductive coil hf near inductive coil uhf far radiative linear near field communications rely completely on magnetic waves  the range is typically just a few inches and has an inverse sixth power  1/r6  relationship with the range  9   as per gausss law or flux theorem  the electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed electric charge  the integral form of gauss 's law is represented as  where e is the electric field  da is a vector representing an infinitesimal element of area  http  //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ gauss % 27s_law  cite_note-4 q is the total charge  0 is the electric constant  and represents the dot product  the surface integral of this dot product denotes the electric flux through the closed surface  s the differential form of gauss 's law is represented as  where e is the divergence of the electric field  and is the charge density  fig  2 different types of rfid transponder antennas 564 amit grover and hal berghel application of the gausss law in the context of an rfid implementation implies that the amount of power absorbed by the transponder is optimal when the electric field created by the interrogator meets the tags at a perpendicular plane  since the strength of the coupling is affected by the antennas capacitance  inductance and thereby the impedance characteristics  this implies that the design of the antenna plays a critical role in the overall performance of the rfid system  applications that require rf coupling at different angles are best served by orientation insensitive antennas that are characterized by multiple turns and branches  whereas those that require direction-specific coupling on flat surfaces are better served by straight and long tags that provide an enhanced conductive area  10  .passive transponder formats that enjoy industry-wide acceptance include the alien 12 tag  the alien squiggle tag  the avery dennison strip tag  and the rafsec folded dipole cct tag  based on the application  the antennas come in many different shapes and sizes  some of which are shown in figure 2  11   3.1 rfid tag construction formats different applications require transponders with different physical characteristics  some common tag construction formats include disks or coins  glass or plastic housing  keys and key fobs  smart labels  coil-on-chips  and those that are embedded in smart cards  12   the various construction formats are summarized in table 2 table 2 rfid tag construction formats disks or coins this is the most common construction format  to withstand higher temperatures  an epoxy resin molding may be used  glass or plas animal tracking and identification can be done by tic housing injecting these transponders under the animals skin  keys and key immobilizers or door locking applications for high security areas  fobs smart labels this is a paper thin format where the tag is produced by careen printing or etching  smart cards contactless smart cards facilitate transactions without swiping the magnetic stripe  wristband this facilitates contact-less access control  565 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues 3.2 tag classifications based on the power source that drives the communication between the tags and the reader  rfid tags can be classified as active  passive  or semi-passive tags  the differences are indicated in table 3 the auto-id center further classified different rfid tags on the basis of their functionality into seven different classes  these classes  as recognized by epcglobal  are summarized in table 4  13  14   table 3 types of rfid tags active has its own battery that is used to broadcast signals over great distances  usually bigger in size and capable of carrying more information  passive no inbuilt power source  the signal from the rfid reader creates an electromagnetic field that powers the tag  much cheaper  semi-passive or battery assisted passive  bap  equipped with an onboard battery that drives the chips circuitry but power for communication of the signal is derived from the readers electromagnetic field as in the case of passive tags  table 4 rfid tag classes class description 1 class 0 passive  read-only uses symbols proprietary protocol  2 class 0+ passive  write-once using class 0 protocols  3 class i passive  read-only backscatter tag with one-time  field-programmable  non-volatile memory  4 class ii passive  write-once  backscatter tag with up to 65 kb of memory and encryption support  5 class iii rewriteable  semi-passive backscatter tag  with up to 65 kb memory  6 class iv rewriteable  active tag that uses a built-in battery to power its own communication with the reader  7 class v similar to class iv tags  but with enhanced capability to power and read class i  ii  and ii tags and to read other class iv and v tags  4 rfid interrogators rfid readers interrogate the tags as they move into the range of the electromagnetic field that has been generated by the radio frequency and supply the tags unique identification data to the middleware for the specific application  these epc class 5 devices are responsible for managing the communication between the different components of a typical rfid infrastructure and include components such as an antenna that transmits the rf wave  a digital signal processor  dsp  chip that controls data transmitted using frequency or amplitude modulation  and a reader application programming interface  api  that facilitates the end-user application to correctly record and interpret tag read events  the dsp chip is also responsible for the real-time data communication between the transponders and the interrogators  characteristics such as directivity  signal gain  polarization  radiation efficiency  form factor  and tag density play a crucial role in selecting readers for different applications  signal directivity is an important issue when phantom-reads introduce errors because rf signals are also read from adjoining interrogation zones  an antennas gain combines its directivity and electrical efficiency and describes how well the antenna transforms input power into radio waves  566 amit grover and hal berghel g = eantenna  d where g = gain eantenna =antenna efficiency  and d = directivity the power gain for a particular direction given by an elevation and azimuth  is represented as   where d    = directive gain  antenna efficiency is either expressed as the ratio between its radiation resistance and its total resistance or as the ratio between its input power and its radiated power  where rtotal = rradiation + rcoil + rground + rother   i.e  the sum of coil losses  rc   ground losses  rg   and other losses  ro  including ohmic and capacitive losses   polarization refers to the orientation of the antenna with respect to the electromagnetic field and can be linear or circular  radiation efficiency depends on the antenna design and reflects the strength of the transmitted signal  the form factor classification for mobile interrogators indicates either a dedicated reader or an add-on interface to conventional computers using technologies such as pcmcia  personal computer memory card international association   sdio  secure digital input output   or compact flash cards  15   tag density refers to the maximum number of transponders that a reader can register per second  the maximum transmission range  rmax  for rfid tags is given by the friis free space formula   16  = wavelength = transmitted power from the reader = gain of transmitter antenna = gain of receiver tag = power transmission coefficient = minimum threshold power of the reader 4.1 ffca  aen  and plcm  rfid implementationconsiderations an rfid implementation requires proper planning to ensure that the new deployment does not interfere with any existing equipment that uses electromagnetic radiation and also to ensure that appropriate rfid components are chosen to deliver optimum performance  given the envi567 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues ronmental constraints  this is achieved by using a technique known as the full faraday cycle analysis  ffca   the ffca has two primary components  aen and plcm  aen is the ambient electromagnetic noise in the environment that is created by other gadgets that can interfere with the radio frequency communication of an rfid implementation  a detailed aen analysis includes identifying all the spots that are susceptible to aen along with their measurements  based on the cause of the aen  steps can be taken to either eliminate the aen or to find a way to accommodate it by selecting the appropriate technologies / components for the rfid solution  the next stage is the process of mapping out the rf path in the different interrogation zones based on the aen measurements  this process is known as rf path loss contour mapping  plcm   17   5 rfid standards and protocols 5.1 electronic product code the universal product code  upc  is a barcode symbology used for tracking retail inventory in stores  upc is based on gs1s gtin-12 and consists of twelve numeric characters that uniquely identify a company 's individual product  the structural detail of a upc symbol is shown in figure 3 the limited amount of data that a upc barcode can accommodate implies that one of its limitations is that it gives information only about the manufacturer and product code  but not about each individual piece of item  typical universal product code symbol out of the total 12 digits encoded  the company prefix can be 6 to 10 digits long fig  3 upc symbol structure  source  http  //www.gtin.info/upc/  this limitation can be overcome by using epc or the electronic product code  which can store much more information  and is designed to serve as a unique global identifier for all physical objects  the epc was developed by the auto-id center as a global and open standard  apart from a unique identification number for each item of the inventory  the epc information can include additional information such as the date of manufacture  the product 's origin  and its shipment destination  etc  the epc structure is defined in the epcglobal tag data standard  it is a 96-bit number that consists of a header and three sets of data  the 96-bit epc can support sufficient capacity for 268 million companies  thereby allowing each manufacturer to support up to 16 million object classes with 68 billion serial numbers in each class  18   an example of a typical epc code is shown in figure 4  568 amit grover and hal berghel fig  4 epc structure header  the header identifies the epc version number  which identifies the type of epc data to follow  epc manager number  the second part of the number identifies the company or manufacturer of the item  object class  the third part refers to the exact type of product and is functionally similar to a stock-keeping unit  sku   serial number  the fourth part is the items unique identifier  apart from the data structure  the epc also covers the air interface protocol and the network for getting tag information  it defines contents and encodings for all the different classes of transponders along with coupling  frequency  and communication protocols for class 0 and class i transponders  19   5.2 rfid air interface protocol the air interface protocol is responsible for communication between the reader and the tags and manages modulation/de-modulation as well as collision avoidance for the transmitted data  the standard used with epc generation 2.0 protocols is the modified slotted aloha protocol  which is a random access protocol for sharing broadcast channel access among a number of users with relatively low throughput demand  anti-collision methods may be designed for space domain  frequency domain  or time domain  most rfid implementations employ time domain anti-collision  wherein fractional communications from the transponders are varied in time  time domain anti-collision methods support both synchronous  as well as asynchronous schemes  20   popular rfid standards used for different applications are listed in table 5  table 5 popular rfid standards standard iso/iec 18000 part 1 1 purpose or application area rfid for item management  generic

applications the phenomenal proliferation of rfid chips in such a short amount of time is testimony to the fact that they can be used in a wide variety of applications to streamline different processes thereby producing a tangible and cost-effective increase in efficiency  common applications that are well suited for rfid system implementations include  21    a  automotive industry i

vehicle registration  j  casino chip tracking  k  library management  l  ids such as edl and passports  m  human implants using verichip 7 rfid privacy issues as rfid proliferation spreads to different application-area ; coupled with an increase in newsreports documenting various security vulnerabilities in rfid systems  a concern about the privacy issues is bound to be there  with rfids being introduced in employee access cards  federal personal identityverification cards  new passports as well as passport cards  national drivers licenses  credit cards  human implants  such as those implemented by the baja beach nightclub in barcelona for the ease of payment for preferred customers   patient tracking systems  personal clothing items and handbags  pet-tracking implants with the owners information  and other merchandise ; the concern about surreptitious and unauthorized tracking of individuals seems well founded  22   since rfid tags embedded in merchandize remain functional even after the products leave the point of sale and are no longer required for supply chain management activities  the unrestricted universal read capability of the tags can be used to monitor the movements of the customer  especially if the data is used in conjunction with his / her credit card or merchant loyalty card when they are used for the financial transactions  23   privacy advocates from consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering  caspian  has exposed instances when these spychips or rfids containing customer ids were embedded in customer loyalty cards without disclosing the fact to the customers  caspian also highlighted an incident where a manufacturer was using hidden cameras activated by rfid chips to track merchandise  this was supposedly done to deter shoplifting  but the tags remained readable even after a customer bought the product and took it home  24   also news articles  such as the one titled  wal-mart uses rfid to track underwear do nothing to increase the common mans confidence in the extent to which rfid chips can be used for invasion of privacy  25   8 rfid vulnerabilities common rfid vulnerabilities include rfid data skimming  tag killing  and susceptibility to a dos attack  these vulnerabilities are described below  8.1 rfid card skimming one of the biggest vulnerabilities of rfid systems is the fact that anyone with access to a 571 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues suitable reader can capture the information stored on the id  this act of surreptitiously grabbing personal information from a victims financial transaction card or any rfid enabled id is known as electronic pick-pocketing  8.2 tag killing rfid systems that support read/write memory are susceptible to unauthorized tag killings from large distances using specially configured readers  this allows the attacker to alter the tag memory content without the owners knowledge  8.3 susceptibility of the epcglobal network to dos attacks the epcglobal network is used to share product information between different stakeholders in the rfid implementation and relies on the electronic product code  epc  of different items  the epcglobal network manages dynamic information such as data regarding the movement of each individual object throughout the product life cycle  this management of all the phases of the supply chain management is achieved by using the following components  i ii  iii  iv  object naming service  ons  epc discovery services epc information services  epcis  epc security services the ons service is used for the discovery of object information on the basis of an epc and uses a mechanism that is similar to the domain name system for resolving ip addresses  the response sent to the requester is a url or ip-address that is obtained from the database when the corresponding electronic product code indicates a match  a similarity in a mechanism with the dns implies similar vulnerabilities and susceptibility to similar threats such as denial of service attacks  8.4 documented hacks documented hacks for spoofing / cloning have highlighted vulnerabilities in almost all popular rfid implementations  including chris pagets cloning of the western hemisphere travel initiative  whti  compliant documents  such as the passport card and electronic drivers license  edl  ; compromising the verichip  mifare classic card  oyster card ; the cracking of the rfid encryption on an american express credit card using an 8 usd reader  which is easily available on ebay  and the hacking of the texas instruments rfid digital signature transponder  dst  used in exxonmobil speedpass systems  etc   26  27  28  29   in december 2007  a demonstration at the 24th chaos communications congress  24c3  in germany highlighted vulnerabilities of the ubiquitous mifare classic rfid chip by reverseengineering the underlying crypto-1 cipher  to make matters worse  it has been shown that it is possible to recover secret keys in mere minutes on an average desktop pc  30   572 amit grover and hal berghel 9 rfid security issues there are a number of serious security concerns that should be examined thoroughly before executing any widespread rfid deployment  some common threats include  9.1 rfid spoofing the process of unauthorized capturing of rfid tag information  including its unique tag id  tid   and the retransmitting of this information to a reader thereby fooling it into believing that the data is coming from a legitimate transponder is known as  rfid spoofing  there have been numerous demonstrations that show the ease with which this can be done given the right equipment  31   9.2 tag cloning when rfid spoofing is done coupled with replicating the original form factor of the tag to give an identical product  the rfid tag is said to have been cloned  rfid cloning is also referred to as a  relay attack  9.3 side channel attacks rouge rfid readers can sniff rf communications between authorized tags and readers and might use confidential information that was obtained for carrying out industrial espionage or other illegal activities  32   such an attack on a generation 1 rfid tag was demonstrated at the 2006 rsa security annual conference  9.4 rfid viruses and worms since rfid systems rely on middleware top communicate with business applications and backend databases  they are susceptible to malware attacks by hackers just as any other software based solution  it has been demonstrated that by merely scanning an infected rfid tag  it is possible to compromise the systems security and cause malicious pre-programmed damage to the backend database of an rfid implementation  once the system has been compromised  the malwares payload can be designed to spread the damage by infecting other tags  based on the propagation vector that is used  rfid malware can be classified as an rfid worm or rfid virus  33   9.4.1 rfid worm an rfid worm is a malware that propagates using network connections by exploiting online rfid services  as well as via rfid tags  the rfid middleware server gets compromised when a legitimate rfid server is tricked into downloading and executing a malicious code  the compromised middleware server then unwittingly propagates the infection by replacing legitimate tag data with a malicious code  9.4.2 rfid virus an rfid virus is a self-replicating malware that does not require a network connection for propagation  once a tag with a specially crafted code is able to infect the backend software of 573 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues fig  5 a virus infected rfid chip  source  http  //www.rfidvirus.org/index.html  the rfid implementation  the middleware can be used to churn out infected tags  which in turn have the capacity to infect the middleware layers of the same software in different geographic locations when these infected tags reach a new location and are scanned by the system  9.5 sql injection sql injection is an attack technique that exploits the vulnerability of database security by injecting a specific code to gain access to the underlying database  if incorrect input is not filtered properly  an attacker can cause real damage to the rfid database using malicious sql commands  9.6 cross -site scripting xss is a web application vulnerability that allows the embedding of form input with malicious scripts  by injecting a client-side script into web pages  attackers can bypass client-side access control mechanisms and if this website is a necessary part of an rfid implementation  the attackers can compromise the rfid backend system  9.7 buffer overflow it is possible to exploit poorly written middleware code that doesnt dynamically check the data capacity of the tags to send irregular amounts of data to the reader and cause a buffer overflow that may either crash the rfid system or compromise some part of it that can be used for launching other attacks such as sql injection to disrupt the integrity of the database  9.8 glue code a glue code is a code that is primarily used to glue together different parts of code to make different modules or components compatible with each other  but that does not specifically contribute towards a specific functional requirement  glue code attacks focus on targeting various types of interfacing codes where there is a greater probability for introducing data format errors and thus crash the system  a typical rfid implementation uses a glue code to interface the rfid readers with the middleware or other end-user applications and is thus susceptible to glue code attacks  574 amit grover and hal berghel 10 countermeasures / precautions the threats and vulnerabilities inherent in rfid systems described above can be minimized to a great extent by employing the following countermeasures  10.1 faraday cages faraday cages or meshes or shields use containers that are coated with certain metals that dont allow rf waves to pass through  good examples include the use of credit card shielding sleeves or passport shielding cases such as those shown in table 6 table 6 rfid shields rfid smart card shielding sleeve  34  rfid passport shielding case  35  rfid shielding flipside wallet  36  10.2 kill command the kill command is a feature built into the rfid transponder that can be activated by a reader by transmitting an access code or pin at the point of sale to make the tag unreadable  37   once the kill command has been executed there is no way to revive the tags usability at a later stage  10.3 sleep command unlike the kill command  the sleep command de-activates the rfid transponder only temporarily  for using the tag again it needs to be activated physically  as a security feature  it cant be re-activated remotely without the users knowledge  10.4 encryption using encryption is a good way to secure the contents of the data that is transmitted so that even if an unauthorized person eavesdrops on the communication  the cipher text would not reveal meaningful information unless the key has also been compromised  the use of cryptographic protocols in conjunction with challenge-response authentication systems or using roll 575 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues ing code schemes  wherein the tag identifier information changes after each scan  are some other ways to make rfid communication more secure  care should be taken not to transmit secret tag information over non-secure communication channels  38   10.5 clipped tags the clipped tag is an rfid tag that allows a consumer to tear off a portion of the tag after an item has been purchased  produced as a collaborative effort by ibm and marnlenrfid  this helps in increasing consumer privacy  as once the antenna is clipped the distance from which the tags can be read is reduced drastically  figure 6 shows an example of the clipped tags  fig  6 clipped tags  source   39   http  //www.gizmag.com/go/5865/  10.6 blocking a possible solution is introducing a blocker tag and extending the tag data structure format to handle a privacy bit that can be turned on or off like the kill command only when the reader has the appropriate access code or pin  40   10.7 reduction of the transmission range an easy solution to prevent unauthorized eavesdropping is to limit the transmission range of the tag to just a few centimeters  however  this method does not provide very strong security against determined eavesdroppers  10.8 randomization one solution is to store a sufficiently large random number as the tag id of a write-once readonly tag and the mapping of this number for the product information should be handled by a secure database so that even if the id information is compromised  it doesnt reveal any meaningful information without access to the backend database  41   10.9 epc gen 2 standards using the epcglobal uhf class 1 generation 2 standard provides slightly more secure communications than generation 1 standards  as it supports a memory-locking feature that can only be accessed by using the appropriate password  though this prevents unauthorized altera 576 amit grover and hal berghel tion of the memory  it is not fully secure  as the password is sent to the tag by the reader using the same channel as the secure data  thereby rendering it susceptible to password breaking attacks  security is provided by encoding data transmitted by the reader using a 16-bit random number as communicated by the tag to the reader  this implementation assumes that strength of the backscattered signal as transmitted by the tag is not sufficient enough to be eavesdropped on by unauthorized entities  however  it has been shown that technologically  this assumption does not hold true  plus  it also adds an overhead in the backend database management system  42   10.10 rfid enterprise application framework based on kerberos another implementation that may be used to enhance security in dynamic rfid application environments is the proposed enterprise application framework that is based on kerberos and abstract business processes that includes a standard communication protocol and diverse security functions  43   10.11 rfid security framework for smart home environments futuristic smart home environments that envisage network and rfid enabled devices such as refrigerators  music systems  air-conditioning systems  mobile rfid-enabled smart phones  kitchen appliances  and other household gadgets are leaving the realm of science fiction and becoming a reality  these smart home networks are susceptible to their own security threats and vulnerabilities  a proposed security framework for rfid-based applications in smart home environment deals with tag locking and other strategies to provide authentication and data confidentiality  as well as integrity  44   10.12 rfid security for ubiquitous computing environments rfid is an integral part of the ubiquitous network computing environment and apart from the traditional focus on an rfid reader system and tag-based security  the practical usefulness of low-priced rfid tags can be increased with the help of a proposed security service that not only ensures availability but also provides for forward channel security and secure statusacquisition technology  45   10.13 other security threats other security threats  such as sql injection  cross -site scripting  buffer overflow  and glue code attacks can be minimized or eliminated by using the following countermeasures  i strong input validation ii  good software design iii  proper filtering rules on the perimeter firewall that controls access to the middleware and end-user applications iv  disabling scripts on the backend system v auditing buffer bounds and thoroughly checking for boundary condition errors vi  accepting cookies only from trusted sites vii  limiting account privileges for users that dont require full administrator access to the software component  577 a survey of rfid deployment and security issues 11 conclusion while the list of applications that may be streamlined or optimized using rfid implementations keeps on growing every day  it is also true that newer exploits keep demonstrating again and again that rfid in its current form is certainly not secure enough to deal safely with transactions involving sensitive personally identifiable and financial information  though it is safe to say the technology has matured enough to be used in inventory management throughout the supply chain  toll-gate payment systems  high value asset tracking for defense applications  animal tracking  casino management  and automobile security ; it would not be wise to completely rely on rfid based solutions for carrying out financial transactions and using id documents embedded with rfid chips unless better safeguards are implemented to ensure foolproof security  while many of the security concerns can be handled by using existing technology  one of the biggest challenges is the general lack of awareness about the various rfid security issues  references  1   2   3   4   5   6
