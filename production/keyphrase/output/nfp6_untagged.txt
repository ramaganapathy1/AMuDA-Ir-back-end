thus  the proposed method has environmental-adaptation capabilities  subsequent experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over a commercial location-based service  lbs  chipset  note to practitionersthe practical motivation of this paper is summarized as follows  first  we would like to develop an indoor wireless localization network that is particularly useful for the position estimation of stationary and/or slowly moving objects  the sensor network developed in this paper can be variously used for factory automation  home automation  robot navigation/guidance  and pedestrian tracking  second  the environmental-adaptive rssi-based indoor localization  earil  algorithm developed in this paper is based on received signal strength ; so the system is very simple and the implementation cost is much cheaper than typical toa and tdoa-based methods  index termsindoor localization  location-based service  lbs   received-signal-strength index  rssi   wireless sensor network  i introduction o ne of the key issues in mobile robot applications is to locate persons and assets placed and possibly moving around a mobile robot  1   in actual applications  it is often difficult to locate pedestrians or stationary objects because the mobile robot is not able to identify them using typical vision or laser scanner sensors  specifically  even though the mobile robot can recognize the shapes of pedestrians and objects based on image processing techniques  it has a limited capability to identify them if they are similar  thus  in the field of mobile robotics  concepts such as intelligent space  ispace   2   ambient intelligence  3    4  and ubiquitous robotic space  urs   1    5    6    8  have been recently proposed in attempts to enhance the capability of a robot in identifying objects and humans  in these concepts  the primary idea is that by attaching a reference tag  the robot is able to easily identify and locate the human or object by detecting the tag  as addressed in  6    7   wireless sensor network  wsn  technologies are considered a manuscript received january 18  2008 ;

for a comprehensive overview  refer to  9  and the references therein  the state-of-the-art technologies in this field are typically based on ultra wideband  uwb ; ieee 802.15.4a   10    11  and zigbee  ieee 802.15.4   however  though uwb-based technologies provide reliable positioning information ; their installation cost is quite high  8   thus  chipcon  http  //www.chipcon.com  commercialized a localization network system  cc2431  based on zigbee as an alternative to uwb  the chipcon  cc2431  chipset uses the received-signal-strength to evaluate the distance between reference nodes and tags ; however  this method has no capability to adapt to environmental variations as it needs an accurate signal propagation model  tuned in advance by the user  in this paper  the received-signal-strength index  rssi  is used to calculate the distances between tags and reference nodes  in the proposed approach  the signal propagation model and model parameters are updated online in a closed-loop feedback correction manner  the novel contribution of this method  though a very simple idea  is to evaluate signal attenuation parameters using reference tags at each sampling time to compute other tags unknown positions  thereby enabling adaptation to environmental variation  this paper is organized as follows  in section ii  an environmentaladaptive rssi-based indoor localization  earil  technique is established  the actual hardware platform and experimental test results are then briefly addressed in section iii  and conclusions will be given in section iv  ii  environmental-adaptive rssi-based indoor localization  earil  this section addresses a new localization method based on rssi that is particularly beneficial for indoor asset tracking  the newly-proposed method has the ability to adapt to environment variations ; thus  it is referred to here as an environmental-adaptive rssi-based indoor localization  earil   recently  rssi-based localizations have attracted considerable attention due to their simplicity and low cost  12   as well as their lower sensitivity to bandwidth and occurrences of undetected-direct paths  13   rssi-based methods compute the distance between a sender and a receiver using the signal-strength received and a relationship between the signal-loss and the propagation distance  the following signal propagation model has been widely used for this relationship i  r  = c i  0  ra  1  where i  r  represents the signal-strength measured at distance r ; c is a proportional constant  i  0  is the signal-strength at a unit distance  and 1545-5955/ $ 26.00 2009 ieee ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 627 a is the attenuation parameter of the signal propagation  traditional rssi approaches aim to calculate the unknown distance r using the measurement i  r  and parameters a ; c  and i  0  modeled in advance  thus  in traditional approaches  the distance r is simply calculated with the fixed parameters a ; c  and i  0  as r=e   2  in actual applications  however  traditional approaches may not be efficient and potentially result in numerous errors because the parameters a ; c  and i  0  are environmental-dependent in the presence of signal interference  deflection  variation of the power radiating from the transmitter  and other complex radio characteristics  the motivation of this research is thus to establish a scheme that is tolerant to parameter variations arising from the shift of environmental characteristics  to this end  the new rssi-based method proposed consists of reference nodes that receive and send radio signals  and a tag that computes its position using a radio propagation model that is updated in real time based on the received-signal-strength  before outlining the algorithms let us first examine the relationships among the parameters of  1   assuming c is fixed  let us suppose that there are parameter variations in a and i  0  such as a0 = a + a and i 0  0  = i  0  + i  0   which change  1  to c i 0  r  = a+a  i  0  + i  0    r  3  this relationship states that if there is a variation in magnitudes of the attenuation parameters and initial signal-strength  the received-signalstrength at the distance r changes from i  r  to i 0  r   in other words  if the model parameters change  the received-signal-strength would be affected ; in such case  if the fixed parameters a and i  0  are used without modification  the distance will be evaluated as r0 = e = e e 1+a=a  i  0  =  i  0  + i  0    1=a  =r fig  1 localization network composed of three reference nodes  transmitter and receiver ; n = 3  and a tag  the arcs  arrows  represent directions of rf communication signal flow between the reference nodes  and between the reference nodes and the tag  illustrates three reference nodes  the number of reference nodes and tags can generally be extended to n  from  1   we need to estimate model parameters a and c based on the received-signal-strengths  for convenience  let us say that the reference node i transmits the radio signal with a strength of ci and receives the signal of the reference node j with a strength of cji ; the tag receives the signal from i with a strength of cit  here  the distance between i and the tag is denoted as ri  and signal attenuation parameter is ai  then  the unknown parameters are ri ; ci  and ai  and their corresponding measurements are cji and cit ; the problem is to determine ri by estimating ai and ci based on the measurements cji and cit  a simple solution for this parameter estimation is to use the known distance between i and j ; i 6= j  that is  since the reference nodes are fixed at known points  and ci and cj are related by the equation n n n =  4  therefore  if parameter variations are not considered  then distance errors of r 0 r0 = r 0 r1+a=a  i  0  =  i  0  + i  0    1=a = r  1 0 ra=a  i  0  =  i  0  + i  0    1=a  will certainly exist  that is  the actual distance is still r even though the signal characteristics have been changed  i.e  from a to a + a and from i  0  to i  0  + i  0    but the estimated distance is r0  as such  it is essential to update the model parameters in such a way that the calculated position properly reflects the variation of environmental characteristics  note that c is a constant  so we can simply consider ci  0  as the initially-radiated signal-strength ; in the following section  c = 1 can thus be used without notational confusion  a localization using fixed reference nodes the concept of localization using fixed reference nodes  lfrn  is illustrated in fig  1 in this figure  the tag measures the received-signalstrength and calculates the distance between the reference nodes and the tag ; the tag is attached to a tracked target  and the reference nodes are placed at known points  the reference node is composed of transmitter and receiver  and the receiver computes model parameters based on the received signal-strengths  which are sent from other reference nodes  also shown in the figure  the radio signal radiating from the transmitter in a reference node is received by the receivers in other reference nodes as well as by the tag  note that though this figure only n n n cji cj =  5   rji  a n n where rji is the distance between the reference nodes i and j  and cji is the signal-strength of j received by i  therefore  aj can be n simply calculated as aj n c =c ln = ln  6  r if cj is known  however  as cj is environmental and time-dependent  cj should be measured or estimated beforehand  to this end  one simple idea is to measure the initially radiated-signal-strength  as depicted in fig  1 that is  cj is measured by the receiver of the reference node j  another method is to use two different reference nodes to estimate cj as well as aj  here  let us suppose that the reference nodes i and k ; i 6= j ; i 6= k ; k 6= j  measure the signal of the reference node j with strengths cji and cjk respectively  then  in addition to  5   we have an additional signal-strength relationship n n n n cjk cj =  rjk  a   7  therefore  using  5  and  7   we are able to obtain aj c = ln r ln 0 lnc 0 lnr  8  628 ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 from which cj is computed by inserting  8  into  5  or  7   to filter out measurement noise  we may then use aj =  n 0 1   1 n 0 2  n i =1 ; i6=j lnc 0 lnc lnr 0 lnr k=1 ; k6=i ; j n   9  the overall procedure is summarized as follows  the receivers  placed within the reference nodes  and the tags receive signals radiating from the transmitters of individual reference nodes  after that  the reference nodes send information including measured-signal-strengths to the tag using a wireless local area network ; the tag then estimates aj using  8  or  9   next  based on  1   the tag can compute the distances between the reference nodes and the tag as ri =  ci=ii  1=a   10  using  10   it is then straightforward to estimate the position of the tag ; a review of these localization algorithms is presented in  14   in  14   if the positions of reference nodes are known as  xi ; yi   then the position of the tag can be simply computed by  ^x ; y^  t =  ht h  01 ht b  11  where h= x2 y2     x3 x4 xn y3 y4 ; b = 21 yn k22 k32 k42 0 r22 + r21 0 r23 + r21 0 r24 + r21 2 kn 0 r2n + r21    12  and ki2 = x2i + yi2  thus far  we have presented a localization method using reference nodes that contain both a transmitter and receiver  the receiver receives radio signals radiating from the transmitter and measures the signal-strength to calculate the signal attenuation parameter  note that the communication load may be heavy in this approach  fig  2 localization network using a mobile reference node  lmrn   where cim is the received-strength of the ith reference node signal  ni  at the mobile reference node  rim is the distance between the mobile reference node and ni ; ci is the initially radiated signal-strength of ni  and ai is the attenuation parameter of the ith signal  now  the problem is to determine the signal attenuation parameter ai and initial signal strength ci based on cim and rim  in this approach  since we are using only one mobile reference node  n ci can not be computed in real time  however  if c0 = i=1  ci  =n is used for ci  then ai can be estimated online based on signal measurements  that is  when the relationship given by  13  is shifted by ai lnr = lnc 0 lnc we can obtain the following relationships  lnr 0 a2 lnr = lnc 0 lnc r a1 ln 0 a3 lnr = lnc 0 lnc a1 b localization using mobile reference nodes the lfrn method of the previous subsection may have a high computational load ; however  if the proposed idea is applied to mobile robot applications  the computational load can be substantially reduced  to achieve this reduction  the concept of localization using mobile reference nodes  lmrn  is illustrated in fig  2  where the robot is seen tracking a pedestrian  the mobile reference node can be considered a mobile robot and the tag can be considered a pedestrian   it is relatively easy to locate the mobile robot using some existing methods  5    15  as numerous sensors and other communication equipment can be installed onto the robot.1 fig  2 shows that the wireless localization network is composed of a mobile reference node  fixed reference nodes  and a tag.2 if the reference tag is mounted on a mobile robot  the reference tag has mobility  referred to as a mobile reference node  ; as the node  its position can be accurately monitored  this mobile reference node can thus be used for the computation of attenuation parameters  here  the signal propagation is governed by the formula cim =  rim  a ci  13  1the mobile robot position is easily estimated from a localization sensor network  see  5  and  15  for examples   2it is assumed that the tag can be attached to the pedestrian   14  an 01 lnr   0 an lnr = lnc 0 lnc  15   16    17  since the above relationships can be expressed in matrix form as m a1 a2   an = lnc 0 lnc lnc 0 lnc lnc    18  0 lnc where m is to be determined from  15   17   the attenuation parameters are computed by  a1 ;

the attenuation parameter was previously estimated as a + a +  thus  the actual signal-strength measured at r will be i 0  r  =  i  0   =  ra+a  + n  where n is the measurement noise  and the distance can be estimated as 4 i  0  1=  a+a+ 4  i 0  r  page  in  28   min = 0 was used and in  30  and  31   r is assumed as r > 1 now  the upper and lower boundaries of r^ can be evaluated using  27    29    30   and  31   then  denoting the right-hand sides of  27    29    30   and  31  as  ;

hence  the battery life of the tag can be extended  fig  4 shows that the reference nodes are composed of a mobile maxf + g  maxf g + maxf g fngra+a  a + a +1minf4g i  0  max + maxfngra+a fngra+a + 1=  a + a + minf4g   1=2  a + a + minf4g  + 1  i  0  min + minfngra+a 3 a+a = a + a10 j43j i  0  jn+jjrn3jra+a 3 a+a 2 3 3 + 1=  a + a 0 j4 j   1=2  a + a 0 j4 j  + 1  i  0  0j0n jjnr3jra+a minf + g  minf g + minf g fngra+a  a + a +1minf4g i  0  min + minfngra+a 1 0j n3 jra+a = a + a 0 j43j i  0  0 jn3jra+a max r0 min r0 r  r0 2  26   27   28   29   30   31  630 ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 fig  3 calculated upper and lower boundaries of r^  and actual r^ when n and 4 are randomly selected  fig  4 fixed reference node is composed of a reference transmitter and a mobile reference tag  the left picture shows the node installed in the wall and the right picture shows the node installed under the ceiling  reference tag3 and a fixed-reference transmitter  in the figure  the image on the left is the reference node attached to the wall and the right image is the reference node attached under the ceiling  fig  5 shows the reference nodes installed in an office  in this architecture  each individual mobile reference tag measures the rssi of the signal radiating from the fixed-reference transmitters  then  each mobile reference tag transmits the data packet to the tag  in the packet  the last two data are coordinate values in the x and y axes of the tag calculated by the chipcon cc2431 chip mounted in the tag  note that cc2431 is one of the most widely used commercial products in indoor localization and has been used to locate a tag based on rssi as in the method established in this paper ; thus  cc2431 is used here as a benchmark for a comparative experimental study  in the left plot  the solid lines  blue  are the calculated x and y of the tag from cc2431 ; the dot-dashed lines  red  are the calculated x and y tag coordinates from lfrn ; and the dashed-lines  black  are the actual values  from these plots  we can see that the proposed method is better in estimating y  though cc2431 is better in calculating x to quantitatively compare the 3the fixed-reference transmitter developed does not operate as a transceiver  thus  it is necessary to place a mobile reference tag that can receive signals from the fixed reference transmitter beside the fixed-reference transmitter so that they  the fixed-reference transmitter and mobile reference tag  work as the fixed reference node in a pair  performances  we then calculated the total errors of the left plot  with the results shown on the right  similarly  fig  7 shows the test results of lfrn when the tag is placed nearby a wall  as shown on the right  the proposed-method again has a better performance than cc2431  fig  6 illustrates the experimental results of the localization algorithm with fixed reference nodes  lfrn  when the tag is placed inside the sensor network  for the experimental test of the localization algorithm with mobile reference nodes  lmrn   we simply turned off all mobile reference tags  and placed the reference mobile tag in an open space ; this reference tag acts as a mobile reference node  table i shows the test results  where the true position is the coordinate of the actual place where the tag was placed  the position measured from cc2431 is written in the 3rd column ; the 4th column is the mean-square error of cc2431  the position estimated by the proposed method is written in the 5th column  and the 6th column is the mean-square error of lmrn  from this table  we could observe that lmrn has noticeably better performance than cc2431 in tests 1  2  3  and 4 ; however  cc2431 is only slightly better than lmrn in test 5 note also that lmrn estimates the tag position much faster than lfrn  finally  we would like to provide several observations from our actual experimental tests  to examine effect according to the antenna orientation  we measured the received-signal-strengths while rotating the mobile tag  ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 631 fig  5 fixed reference nodes installed in an office  fig  6 experimental test results of lfrn inside the sensor network  no particular variation of performance due to antenna orientation was observed  with more reference nodes  the overall quality is only slightly improved  for further discussion of this topic  refer to  16   since our system uses rf signals to communicate between reference nodes and mobile tags  the performance can be affected by surrounding objects  most notably by metallic objects  we also observed that the initial radiation intensity is dependent on the gap between the rf circuit board and the wall  thus  in future efforts  it is necessary to pay more attention to the rf circuit board design  to ensure it is more robust in terms of hardware and against interference from metallic objects  our system is based on a zigbee communication ; thus  overall communication is governed by the zigbee protocol  ieee 802.15.4   if congestion exists during the network transfer  the tag transmits a resend signal to the nodes  or an acknowledgement signal when a signal is safely received   thus all signals are confirmed to be safely transmitted  from the experiments  the 632 ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 fig  7 experimental test results of lfrn near a wall  table i comparison of performance between cc2431 and lmrn sampling time of lfrn is about 2 s  whereas the sampling time of lmrn was as low as 0.1 s.4 iv  concluding remarks in this paper  we proposed a localization method referred to as an environmental-adaptive rssi-based indoor localization  earil  that is tolerant to parameter variations caused by environmental variations  here  two algorithms  lfrn and lmrn  have been implemented in a zigbee-based  2.4 ghz rf communication system  sensor network  the hardware required for these tests was developed and subsequently tested in an office environment  from the comparisons with an existing localization chipset chipcon cc2431  a dominant rssi-based localization product  we found that lfrn locates the position of an object more accurately than cc2431 as time increases  moreover  lmrn estimates the tag position much faster than lfrn and computes the position more accurately in an open space ; four cases out of five were better than cc2431 and the other case was only slightly worse than cc2431  thus  we can confirm that lfrn is particularly helpful for the position estimation of a stationary object in an office environment  whereas lmrn is more practical for use in robot applications in an open space  since earil is based on rssi  the system is very simple and the cost of implementation is much cheaper than time-of-arrival  toa  and time-difference-of-arrival  tdoa  -based methods  finally  it is stressed that earil has a novel feature of environmental adaptation ; that is  the mobile tag is able to compute its position using an online-updated propagation model parameter  4from our experimental tests we found that the sampling times of the existing wsn localization systems such as uwb  example  ubisense system  http  // www.ubisense.net   1    8   and zigbee  example  chipcon cc2431  are several seconds  references  1  h.-s ahn  w yu  and j lee  wireless localization network for ubiquitous robotic space  approaches and experimental test  in proc  ieee int  symp  robot human interactive commun  jeju  korea  aug 2007   2  j.-h lee  n ando  and h hashimoto  intelligent space for human and mobile robot  in proc  1999 ieee/asme int  conf  adv  intel  mech  atlanta  ga  sep 1999   3  j lee  k morioka  n ando  and h hashimoto  cooperation of distributed intelligent sensors in intelligent environment  ieee/asme trans  mechatronics  vol  9  no  3  pp  535543  sep 2004   4  t sato  robotic room  human behavior measurement  behavior accumulation and personal/behavioral adaptation by intelligent environment  in proc  ieee/asme int  conf  adv  intell  mech  jul  2003  pp  2024   5  w yu  h chae  j y lee  n l doh  and y.-j  cho  robot localization network for development of ubiquitous robotic space  in proc  2006 int  symp  flexible automation  isfa06  osaka  japan  2006   6  w yu  j.-y  lee  h.-s ahn  y.-g ha  m jang  j.-c sohn  and y.-m kwon  design and implementation of a ubiquitous robotic space  ieee trans  automat  sci  eng  to be published   7  h.-s ahn and w yu  wireless localization network for a ubiquitous robotic space  background and concept  in proc  3rd int  conf  ubiquitous robot  ambient intell  seoul  korea  2006  pp  187192   8  h.-s ahn  j lee  w yu  and k.-s han  indoor localization technique for intelligent robotic space  etris new technologies  vol  22  pp  4857  2007   9  j hightower and g borriello  location systems for ubiquitous computing  computer  vol  34  no  8  pp  5766  2001   10  i oppermann  l stoica  a rabbachin  z shelby  and j haapola  uwb wireless sensor networks  uwen-a practical examples  ieee commun  mag  vol  42  pp  s27s32  2004   11  k yu  j p montillet  and a rabbachin  uwb location and tracking for wireless embedded networks  signal process  vol  86  pp  21532171  2006   12  m zhang  s zhang  j cao  and h mei  a novel indoor localization method based on received signal strength using discrete fourier transform  in proc  1st int  conf  commun  netw  china  beijing  china  2006  pp  15 ieee transactions on automation science and engineering  vol  6  no  4  october 2009 633  13  a hatami and k pahlavan  performance comparison of rss and toa indoor geolocation based on uwb measurement of channel characteristics  in proc  ieee 17th int  symp  personal  indoor and mobile radio commun  helsinki  finland  2006  pp  16   14  a h sayed  a tarighat  and n khajehnouri  networked-based wireless location  ieee signal process  mag  vol  22  no  4  pp  2440  2005   15  h chae  j lee  w yu  and n l doh  starlite  a new artificial landmark for the navigation of mobile robots  in proc  1st japankorea joint symp  netw  robot syst  kyoto  japan  2005   16  s park  h.-s ahn  and w yu  adaptive path-loss model-based indoor localization  in proc  ieee int  conf  consumer electron  las vegas  nv  jan 2008 design and implementation of a ubiquitous robotic space wonpil yu  jae-yeong lee  young-guk ha  minsu jang  joo-chan sohn  yong-moo kwon  and hyo-sung ahn abstractthis paper describes a concerted effort to design and implement a robotic service framework  the proposed framework is comprised of three conceptual spaces  physical  semantic  and virtual spaces  collectively referred to as a ubiquitous robotic space  we implemented a prototype robotic security application in an office environment  which confirmed that the proposed framework is an efficient tool for developing a robotic service employing it infrastructure  particularly for integrating heterogeneous technologies and robotic platforms  index termslocalization network  mobile robot  navigation  ubiquitous robotic space  wireless sensor network  i introduction a mbient intelligence denotes a digital environment that proactively  but sensibly  supports people in their daily lives  1   from a robotics viewpoint  this type of smart space further supports a robot in understanding the environment and thus improves its interaction capability  robotic room  2   omniscient space  3   and wabot-house  4  are a few examples of smart spaces that incorporate robotics  since the implementation of a smart space requires the integration of a large number of heterogeneous components  architectural issues have also received much attention  as examples  luo and colleagues described a prototypical configuration for networked robot systems  5  ;

table i describes the structural features of the respective works introduced above  as well as the primary differences from our current work  it should be noted that the structural and functional roles of the three proposed spaces are similar to the work conducted by saffiotti and colleagues  8   as opposed to the aforementioned works  however  we paid much attention to the issue in integrating a large number of heterogeneous technologies and robotic components in the implementation of an actual robotic service  this paper describes how we developed the fundamental elements of each space and how we could integrate the three independently developed spaces into an actual robotic application  the remainder of this paper is organized as follows  section ii describes the basic elements of the physical space and characteristics of each individual element  section iii introduces the semantic space and its elements  the virtual space is described in section iv  and a robotic security application based on the proposed ubiquitous robotic space is described in section v section vi then concludes this paper and introduces further works  ii  the physical space wireless sensor networks and localization networks are two fundamental components supporting the physical space  controlling the behavior of a robot inside the physical space  another component essen 1545-5955/ $ 26.00 2009 ieee
