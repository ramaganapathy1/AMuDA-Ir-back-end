astonishing growth of wireless systems has been witnessed in recent years  wireless technologies have entered the realms of consumer applications  as well as medical  industrial  public safety  logistics  and transport system along with many other applications  self-organizing sensor networks  location sensitive billing  ubiquitous computing  context-dependent information services  tracking  and guiding are some of the numerous possible application areas  since wireless information access is now widely available  there is a high demand for accurate positioning in wireless networks  including indoor and outdoor environments  1    2   the process of determining a location is called location sensing  geolocation  position location  or radiolocation  if it uses wireless technologies  different applications may require different types of location information  the main types discussed in this paper are physical location  symbolic location  absolute location  and relative location  1   physical location is expressed in the form of coordinates  which identify a point on a 2-d/3-d map  the widely used coordinate systems are degree/minutes/seconds  dms   degree decimal minutes  and universal transverse mercator  utm  system  symbolic location expresses a location in a natural-language way  such as in the office  in the third-floor bedroom  etc  absolute location uses a shared reference grid for all located objects  a relative location depends on its own frame of reference  relative location information is usually based on the proximity to known reference points or base stations  various wireless technologies are used for wireless indoor location  these may be classified based on  1  the location positioning algorithm  i.e  the method of determining location  making use of various types of measurement of the signal such as time of flight  tof   angle  and signal strength ; 2  the physical layer or location sensor infrastructure  i.e  the wireless technology used to communicate with the mobile devices or static devices  in general  measurement involves the transmission and reception of signals between hardware components of the system  an indoor wireless positioning system consists of at least two separate hardware components  a signal transmitter and a measuring unit  the latter usually carries the major part of the system intelligence  there are four different system topologies for positioning systems  3   the first one is the remote positioning system  whose signal transmitter is mobile and several fixed measuring units receive the transmitters signal  the results from all measuring units are collected  and the location of the transmitter is computed in a master station  the second is self-positioning in which the measuring unit is mobile  this unit receives the signals of several transmitters in known locations  and has the capability to compute its location based on the measured signals  if a wireless 1094-6977/ $ 25.00 2007 ieee 1068 ieee transactions on systems  man  and cyberneticspart c  applications and reviews  vol  37  no  6  november 2007 data link is provided in a positioning system  it is possible to send the measurement result from a self-positioning measuring unit to the remote side  and this is called indirect remote positioning  which is the third system topology  if the measurement result is sent from a remote positioning side to a mobile unit via a wireless data link  this case is named indirect self-positioning  which is the fourth system topology  our paper is different from the previous survey papers  1  and  2  in several ways  comparing with the previous survey paper  1   our paper focuses on indoor application of wireless location positioning while  1  just generally describes the location systems for ubiquitous computing  without addressing different types of location algorithms  especially for wireless location methods  also  the paper  2  presents a slight out-ofdate overview of the technologies for wireless indoor location solutions  and does not offer much detail about them and performance benchmarking for indoor wireless positioning system  the publication date of this paper is 2002  and since then  several wireless indoor positioning systems or solutions have been developed  in this paper  we present the latest developed systems or solutions  and their location algorithms  our main purpose is to provide a qualitative overview for them  when possible  we also offer a quantitive comparison of these systems or solutions  this review paper is organized as follows  section ii shows the measuring principles for location sensing and the positioning algorithms corresponding to different measuring principles  performance metrics for indoor positioning techniques are explained in section iii  section iv presents current wireless indoor positioning systems and solutions  and their performance comparison  finally  section v concludes the paper and gives possible future directions for research on wireless positioning systems for indoor environments  ii  measuring principles and positioning algorithms it is not easy to model the radio propagation in the indoor environment because of severe multipath  low probability for availability of line-of-sight  los  path  and specific site parameters such as floor layout  moving objects  and numerous reflecting surfaces  there is no good model for indoor radio multipath characteristic so far  2   except using traditional triangulation  positioning algorithms using scene analysis or proximity are developed to mitigate the measurement errors  targeting different applications or services  these three algorithms have unique advantages and disadvantages  hence  using more than one type of positioning algorithms at the same time could get better performance  a triangulation triangulation uses the geometric properties of triangles to estimate the target location  it has two derivations  lateration and angulation  lateration estimates the position of an object by measuring its distances from multiple reference points  so  it is also called range measurement techniques  instead of measuring the distance directly using received signal strengths  rss   time of arrival  toa  or time difference of arrival  tdoa  is usually measured  and the distance is derived by computing the fig  1 positioning based on toa/rtof measurements  attenuation of the emitted signal strength or by multiplying the radio signal velocity and the travel time  roundtrip time of flight  rtof  or received signal phase method is also used for range estimation in some systems  angulation locates an object by computing angles relative to multiple reference points  in this survey  we focus on the aforementioned measurements in the shorter range  low-antenna  and indoor environment  1  lateration techniques  a  toa  the distance from the mobile target to the measuring unit is directly proportional to the propagation time  in order to enable 2-d positioning  toa measurements must be made with respect to signals from at least three reference points  as shown in fig  1  4   for toa-based systems  the one-way propagation time is measured  and the distance between measuring unit and signal transmitter is calculated  in general  direct toa results in two problems  first  all transmitters and receivers in the system have to be precisely synchronized  second  a timestamp must be labeled in the transmitting signal in order for the measuring unit to discern the distance the signal has traveled  toa can be measured using different signaling techniques such as direct sequence spread-spectrum  dsss   22    23  or ultrawide band  uwb  measurements  78   a straightforward approach uses a geometric method to compute the intersection points of the circles of toa  the position of the target can also be computed by minimizing the sum of squares of a nonlinear cost function  i.e  least-squares algorithm  4    5   it assumes that the mobile terminal  located at  x0  y0   transmits a signal at time t0  the n base stations located at  x1  y1    x2  y2        xn  yn  receive the signal at time t1  t2      tn  as a performance measure  the cost function can be formed by f  x  = n  i2 fi2  x   1  i=1 where i can be chosen to reflect the reliability of the signal received at the measuring unit i  and fi  x  is given as follows   fi  x  = c  ti t   xi x  2 +  yi y  2  2  where c is the speed of light  and x =  x  y  t  t  this function is formed for each measuring unit  i = 1      n  and fi  x  could be made zero with the proper choice of x  y  and t the location estimate is determined by minimizing the function f  x   there are other algorithms for toa-based indoor location system such as closest-neighbor  cn  and residual weighting  rwgh   5   the cn algorithm estimates the location of the liu et al   survey of wireless indoor positioning techniques and systems 1069 fig  3 positioning based on rss  where ls 1  ls 2  and ls 3 denote the measured path loss  received signals over a time period t  1 t rx i  x j   = xi  t  xj  t  dt  t 0 fig  2 positioning based on tdoa measurements  user as the location of the base station or reference point that is located closest to that user  the rwgh algorithm can be basically viewed as a form of weighted least-squares algorithm  it is suitable for los  non-los  nlos  and mixed los/nlos channel conditions  b  tdoa  the idea of tdoa is to determine the relative position of the mobile transmitter by examining the difference in time at which the signal arrives at multiple measuring units  rather than the absolute arrival time of toa  for each tdoa measurement  the transmitter must lie on a hyperboloid with a constant range difference between the two measuring units  the equation of the hyperboloid is given by ri  j =   xi x  2 +  yi y  2 +  zi z  2   xj x  2 +  yj y  2 +  zj z  2  3  where  xi  yi  zi  and  xj  yj  zj  represent the fixed receivers i and j ; and  x  y  z  represent the coordinate of the target  3   except the exact solutions to the hyperbolic tdoa equation shown in  3  through nonlinear regression  an easier solution is to linearize the equations through the use of a taylor-series expansion and create an iterative algorithm  6   a 2-d target location can be estimated from the two intersections of two or more tdoa measurements  as shown in fig  2 two hyperbolas are formed from tdoa measurements at three fixed measuring units  a  b  and c  to provide an intersection point  which locates the target p the conventional methods for computing tdoa estimates are to use correlation techniques  tdoa can be estimated from the cross correlation between the signals received at a pair of measuring units  suppose that for the transmitted signal s  t   the received signal at measuring unit i is xi  t   assume that xi  t  is corrupted by the noise ni  t  and delayed by di  then xi  t  = s  t di  + ni  t   similarly  the signal xj  t  = s  t dj  + nj  t   which arrives at measuring unit j  is delayed by dj and corrupted by the noise nj  t   the cross-correlation function of these signals is given by integrating the lag product of two  4  the tdoa estimate is the value that maximizes rx i  x j    i.e  the range differences  this approach requires that the measuring units share a precise time reference and reference signals  but does not impose any requirement on the mobile target  frequency domain processing techniques are usually used to calculate  except the previous tdoa methods  a delay measurement-based tdoa measuring method was proposed in  23  for 802  11 wireless lans  which eliminates the requirement of initial synchronization in the conventional methods  c  rss-based  or signal attenuation-based  method  the above two schemes have some drawbacks  for indoor environments  it is difficult to find a los channel between the transmitter and the receiver  radio propagation in such environments would suffer from multipath effect  the time and angle of an arrival signal would be affected by the multipath effect ; thus  the accuracy of estimated location could be decreased  an alternative approach is to estimate the distance of the mobile unit from some set of measuring units  using the attenuation of emitted signal strength  signal attenuation-based methods attempt to calculate the signal path loss due to propagation  theoretical and empirical models are used to translate the difference between the transmitted signal strength and the received signal strength into a range estimate  as shown in fig  3 due to severe multipath fading and shadowing present in the indoor environment  path-loss models do not always hold  the parameters employed in these models are site-specific  the accuracy of this method can be improved by utilizing the premeasured rss contours centered at the receiver  7  or multiple measurements at several base stations  a fuzzy logic algorithm shown in  8  is able to significantly improve the location accuracy using rss measurement  d  rtof  this method is to measure the time-of-flight of the signal traveling from the transmitter to the measuring unit and back  called the rtof  see fig  1   for rtof  a more moderate relative clock synchronization requirement replaces the above synchronization requirement in toa  its range measurement mechanism is the same as that of the toa  the measuring unit is considered as a common radar  a target transponder responds to the interrogating radar signal  and the complete roundtrip propagation time is measured by the measuring units  however  it is still difficult for the measuring unit to know the exact delay/processing time caused by the responder in this case  in long-range or medium-range systems  this delay could 1070 ieee transactions on systems  man  and cyberneticspart c  applications and reviews  vol  37  no  6  november 2007 fig  4 positioning based on signal phase  fig  5 positioning based on aoa measurement  be ignored if it is small  compared with the transmission time  however  for short-range systems  it can not be ignored  an alternative approach is to use the concept of modulated reflection  9   which is only suited for short-range systems  an algorithm to measure rtof of wireless lan packets is presented in  10  with the result of a measurement error of a few meters  the positioning algorithms for toa can be directly applicable for rtof  e  received signal phase method  the received signal phase method uses the carrier phase  or phase difference  to estimate the range  this method is also called phase of arrival  poa   2   assuming that all transmitting stations emit pure sinusoidal signals that are of the same frequency f  with zero phase offset  in order to determine the phases of signals received at a target point  the signal transmitted from each transmitter to the receiver needs a finite transit delay  in fig  4  the transmitter stations a up to d are placed at particular locations within an imaginary cubic building  the delay is expressed as a fraction of the signals wavelength  and is denoted with the symbol i =  2f di  /c in equation si  t  = sin  2f t + i   where i  a  b  c  d   and c is the speed of light  as long as the transmitted signals wavelength is longer than the diagonal of the cubic building  i.e  0 < i < 2  we can get the range estimation di =  ci  /  2f   then  we can use the same positioning algorithms using toa measurement  the receiver may measure phase differences between two signals transmitted by pairs of stations  and positioning systems are able to adopt the algorithms using tdoa measurement to locate the target  for an indoor positioning system  it is possible to use the signal phase method together with toa/tdoa or rss method to fine-tune the location positioning  however  the received signal phase method has one problem of ambiguous carrier phase measurements to overcome  it needs an los signal path  otherwise it will cause more errors for the indoor environment  2  angulation techniques  aoa estimation   in aoa  the location of the desired target can be found by the intersection of several pairs of angle direction lines  each formed by the circular radius from a base station or a beacon station to the mobile target  as shown in fig  5  aoa methods may use at least two known reference points  a  b   and two measured angles 1  2 to derive the 2-d location of the target p  estimation of aoa  commonly referred to as direction finding  df   can be accomplished either with directional antennae or with an array of antennae  the advantages of aoa are that a position estimate may be determined with as few as three measuring units for 3-d positioning or two measuring units for 2-d positioning  and that no time synchronization between measuring units is required  the disadvantages include relatively large and complex hardware requirement  s   and location estimate degradation as the mobile target moves farther from the measuring units  for accurate positioning  the angle measurements need to be accurate  but the high accuracy measurements in wireless networks may be limited by shadowing  by multipath reflections arriving from misleading directions  or by the directivity of the measuring aperture  some literatures also call aoa as direction of arrival  doa   for more detailed discussions on aoa estimation algorithms and their properties  see  11   13   b scene analysis rf-based scene analysis refers to the type of algorithms that first collect features  fingerprints  of a scene and then estimate the location of an object by matching online measurements with the closest a priori location fingerprints  rss-based location fingerprinting is commonly used in scene analysis  location fingerprinting refers to techniques that match the fingerprint of some characteristic of a signal that is location dependent  there are two stages for location fingerprinting  offline stage and online stage  or run-time stage   during the offline stage  a site survey is performed in an environment  the location coordinates/labels and respective signal strengths from nearby base stations/measuring units are collected  during the online stage  a location positioning technique uses the currently observed signal strengths and previously collected information to figure out an estimated location  the main challenge to the techniques based on location fingerprinting is that the received signal strength could be affected by diffraction  reflection  and scattering in the propagation indoor environments  there are at least five location fingerprinting-based positioning algorithms using pattern recognition technique so far  probabilistic methods  k-nearest-neighbor  knn   neural networks  support vector machine  svm   and smallest m-vertex polygon  smp   1  probabilistic methods  one method considers positioning as a classification problem  assuming that there are n location candidates l1  l2  l3      ln  and s is the observed signal strength vector during the online stage  the following decision rule can be obtained  choose li if p  li |s  > p  lj |s   for i  j = 1  2  3      n  j = i liu et al   survey of wireless indoor positioning techniques and systems here  p  li |s  denotes the probability that the mobile node is in location li  given that the received signal vector is s also assume that p  li  is the probability that the mobile node is in location li  the given decision rule is based on posteriori probability  using bayes formula  and assuming that p  li  = p  lj  for i  j = 1  2  3      n we have the following decision rule based on the likelihood that  p  s|li  is the probability that the signal vector s is received  given that the mobile node is located in location li  choose li if p  s|li  > p  s|lj   for i  j = 1  2  3      n  j = i in addition to the histogram approach  kernel approach is used in calculating likelihood  assuming that the likelihood of each location candidate is a gaussian distribution  the mean and standard deviation of each location candidate can be calculated  if the measuring units in the environment are independent  we can calculate the overall likelihood of one location candidate by directly multiplying the likelihoods of all measuring units  therefore  the likelihood of each location candidate can be calculated from observed signal strengths during the online stage  and the estimated location is to be decided by the previous decision rule  however  this is applicable only for discrete location candidates  mobile units could be located at any position  not just at the discrete points  the estimated 2-d location  x  y  given by  5  may interpolate the position coordinates and give more accurate results  it is a weighted average of the coordinates of all sampling locations  x  y  = n   p  li |s   xl i  yl i     5  i=1 other probabilistic modeling techniques for location-aware and location-sensitive applications in wireless networks may involve pragmatically important issues like calibration  active learning  error estimation  and tracking with history  so bayesian-network-based and/or tracking-assisted positioning has been proposed  48   2  knn  the knn averaging uses the online rss to search for k closest matches of known locations in signal space from the previously-built database according to root mean square errors principle  by averaging these k location candidates with or without adopting the distances in signal space as weights  an estimated location is obtained via weighted knn or unweighted knn  in this approach  k is the parameter adapted for better performance  3  neural networks  during the offline stage  rss and the corresponding location coordinates are adopted as the inputs and the targets for the training purpose  after training of neural networks  appropriate weights are obtained  usually  a multilayer perceptron  mlp  network with one hidden layer is used for neural-networks-based positioning system  the input vector of signal strengths is multiplied by the trained input weight matrix  and then added with input layer bias if bias is chosen  the result is put into the transfer function of the hidden layer neuron  the output of this transfer function is multiplied by the trained hidden layer weight matrix  and then added to the hidden layer 1071 bias if it is chosen  the output of the system is a two-element vector or a three-elements vector  which means the 2-d or 3-d of the estimated location  4  svm  svm is a new and promising technique for data classification and regression  it is a tool for statistical analysis and machine learning  and it performs very well in many classification and regression applications  svms have been used extensively for a wide range of applications in science  medicine  and engineering with excellent empirical performance  15    16   the theory of svm is found in  17  and  18   support vector classification  svc  of multiple classes and support vector regression  svr  have been used successfully in location fingerprinting  19    20   5  smp  smp uses the online rss values to search for candidate locations in signal space with respect to each signal transmitter separately  m-vertex polygons are formed by choosing at least one candidate from each transmitter  suppose total of m transmitters   averaging the coordinates of vertices of the smallest polygon  which has the shortest perimeter  gives the location estimate  smp has been used in multiloc  74   c proximity proximity algorithms provide symbolic relative location information  usually  it relies upon a dense grid of antennas  each having a well-known position  when a mobile target is detected by a single antenna  it is considered to be collocated with it  when more than one antenna detects the mobile target  it is considered to be collocated with the one that receives the strongest signal  this method is relatively simple to implement  it can be implemented over different types of physical media  in particular  the systems using infrared radiation  ir  and radio frequency identification  rfid  are often based on this method  another example is the cell identification  cell-id  or cell of origin  coo  method  this method relies on the fact that mobile cellular networks can identify the approximate position of a mobile handset by knowing which cell site the device is using at a given time  the main benefit of cell-id is that it is already in use today and can be supported by all mobile handsets  iii  performance metrics it is not enough to measure the performance of a positioning technique only by observing its accuracy  referring to  21  and considering the difference between the indoor and outdoor wireless geolocation  we provide the following performance benchmarking for indoor wireless location system  accuracy  precision  complexity  scalability  robustness  and cost  thereafter  we make a comparison among different systems and solutions in section iv  a accuracy accuracy  or location error  is the most important requirement of positioning systems  usually  mean distance error is adopted as the performance metric  which is the average euclidean distance between the estimated location and the true location  accuracy can be considered to be a potential bias  or 1072 ieee transactions on systems  man  and cyberneticspart c  applications and reviews  vol  37  no  6  november 2007 systematic effect/offset of a positioning system  the higher the accuracy  the better the system ; however  there is often a tradeoff between accuracy and other characteristics  some compromise between suitable accuracy and other characteristics is needed  b precision accuracy only considers the value of mean distance errors  however  location precision considers how consistently the system works  i.e  it is a measure of the robustness of the positioning technique as it reveals the variation in its performance over many trials  we also notice that some literatures define the location precision as the standard deviation in the location error or the geometric dilution of precision  gdop   but we prefer it as the distribution of distance error between the estimated location and the true location  usually  the cumulative probability functions  cdf  of the distance error is used for measuring the precision of a system  when two positioning techniques are compared  if their accuracies are the same  we prefer the system with the cdf graph  which reaches high probability values faster  because its distance error is concentrated in small values  in practice  cdf is described by the percentile format  for example  one system has a location precision of 90 % within 2.3 m  the cdf of distance error of 2.3 m is 0.9   and 95 % within 3.5 m ; another one has a precision of 50 % within 2.3 m and 95 % within 3.3 m we could choose the former system because of its higher precision  c complexity complexity of a positioning system can be attributed to hardware  software  and operation factors  in this paper  we emphasize on software complexity  i.e  computing complexity of the positioning algorithm  if the computation of the positioning algorithm is performed on a centralized server side  the positioning could be calculated quickly due to the powerful processing capability and the sufficient power supply  if it is carried out on the mobile unit side  the effects of complexity could be evident  most of the mobile units lack strong processing power and long battery life ; so  we would prefer positioning algorithms with low complexity  usually  it is difficult to derive the analytic complexity formula of different positioning techniques ; thus  the computing time is considered  location rate is an important indicator for complexity  the dual of location rate is location lag  which is the delay between a mobile target moving to a new location and reporting the new location of that target by the system  d robustness a positioning technique with high robustness could function normally even when some signals are not available  or when some of the rss value or angle character are never seen before  sometimes  the signal from a transmitter unit is totally blocked  so the signal can not be obtained from some measuring units  the only information to estimate the location is the signal from other measuring units  sometimes  some measuring units could be out of function or damaged in a harsh environment  the positioning techniques have to use this incomplete information to compute the location  e scalability the scalability character of a system ensures the normal positioning function when the positioning scope gets large  usually  the positioning performance degrades when the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases  a location system may need to scale on two axes  geography and density  geographic scale means that the area or volume is covered  density means the number of units located per unit geographic area/space per time period  as more area/space is covered or units are crowded in an area/space  wireless signal channels may become congested  more calculation may be needed to perform location positioning  or more communication infrastructure may be required  another measure of scalability is the dimensional space of the system  the current system can locate the objects in 2-d or 3-d space  some systems can support both 2-d and 3-d spaces  f cost the cost of a positioning system may depend on many factors  important factors include money  time  space  weight  and energy  the time factor is related to installation and maintenance  mobile units may have tight space and weight constraints  measuring unit density is considered to be a space cost  sometimes  we have to consider some sunk costs  for example  a positioning system layered over a wireless network may be considered to have no hardware cost if all the necessary units of that network have already been purchased for other purposes  energy is an important cost factor of a system  some mobile units  e.g  electronic article surveillance  eas  tags and passive rfid tags  which are addressed later  are completely energy passive  these units only respond to external fields and  thus  could have an unlimited lifetime  other mobile units  e.g  devices with rechargeable battery  have a lifetime of several hours without recharging  iv  survey of systems and solutions having identified the common measuring principles  the positioning algorithms and the important performance metrics of location positioning systems  we are able to discuss specific systems  there are two basic approaches to designing a wireless geolocation system  the first approach is to develop a signaling system and a network infrastructure of location measuring units focused primarily on wireless location application  the second approach is to use an existing wireless network infrastructure to locate a target  the advantage of the first approach is that the designers are able to control physical specification and  consequently  the quality of the location sensing results  the tag with the target can be designed as a very small wearable tag or sticker  and the density of the sensor can be adjusted to the required positioning accuracy  the advantage of the second approach is that it avoids expensive and time-consuming deployment of infrastructure  these systems  however  may need liu et al   survey of wireless indoor positioning techniques and systems 1073 tracking sensitivity beyond 158 dbm4  its performance is not reported so far  locata corporation has invented a new positioning technology called locata  26   for precision positioning both indoors and outside  part of the locata technology consists of a time-synchronized pseudolite transceiver called a locatalite  a network of locatalites forms a locatanet  which transmits gps-like signals that allow single-point positioning using carrier-phase measurements for a mobile device  a locata   the satellite navigation and positioning  snap  group at the university of new south wales has assisted in the development of a locata and testing of the new technology  the test experiments demonstrate proof-of-concept for the locata technology  and show that carrier-phase point positioning  without radio modem data links  is possible with subcentimeter precision  26   fig  6 outline of current wireless-based positioning systems  b rfid to use more intelligent algorithms to compensate for the low accuracy of the measured metrics  several types of wireless technologies are used for indoor location  fig  6 depicts a rough outline of the current wireless-based positioning systems  which is a modified version of  24  fig  2   it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a complete overview of systems available till now  we focus on the wireless positioning systems primarily for indoor situations  there are some classification approaches to surveying the indoor positioning system  such as application environments  such as 2-d/3-d positioning in office  warehouse  etc    positioning algorithms  and wireless technologies  in this paper  we adopt the wireless technologies scheme  also addressing their positioning algorithms and their application situation  a gps-based global positioning system  gps   or its differential complement dgps  25   is one of the most successful positioning systems in outdoor environments  however  poor coverage of satellite signal for indoor environments decreases its accuracy and makes it unsuitable for indoor location estimation  snaptrack,1 a qualcomm company  pioneered wireless assisted gps  a-gps  to overcome the limitations of conventional gps  and provide gps indoors technique with an average of 550 m accuracy in most indoor environments  a-gps technology uses a location server with a reference gps receiver that can simultaneously detect the same satellites as the wireless handset  or mobile station  with a partial gps receiver  to help the partial gps receiver find weak gps signals  the wireless handset collects measurements from both the gps constellation and the wireless mobile network  these measurements are combined by the location server to produce a position estimation  recently  atmel2 and u-blox3 announced the availability of a new gps weak signal tracking technology  called supersense  with this new gps software  gps navigation becomes possible in building interiors and deep urban canyons because of its rfid is a means of storing and retrieving data through electromagnetic transmission to an rf compatible integrated circuit and is now being seen as a means of enhancing data handling processes  27   an rfid system has several basic components  including a number of rfid readers  rfid tags  and the communication between them  the rfid reader is able to read the data emitted from rfid tags  rfid readers and tags use a defined rf and protocol to transmit and receive data  rfid tags are categorized as either passive or active  passive rfid tags operate without a battery  they are mainly used to replace the traditional barcode technology and are much lighter  smaller in volume  and less expensive than active tags  they reflect the rf signal transmitted to them from a reader and add information by modulating the reflected signal  however  their ranges are very limited  the typical reading range is 12 m  and the cost of the readers is relatively high  passive rfid systems usually make use of four frequency bands  lf  125 khz   hf  13.56 mhz   uhf  433  868915 mhz   and microwave frequency  2.45 ghz  5.8 ghz  .20 bewator5 is a known passive rfid manufacturer  active rfid tags are small transceivers  which can actively transmit their id  or other additional data  in reply to an interrogation  frequency ranges used are similar to the passive rfid case except the low-frequency and high-frequency ranges  the advantages of active rfid are with the smaller antennae and in the much longer range  can be tens of meters   active tags are ideally suited for the identification of high-unit-value products moving through a harsh assembly process  wavetrend technologies6 is one of the famous active rfid manufacturers  a well-known location sensing system using the rfid technology is spoton  28   spoton uses an aggregation algorithm for 3-d location sensing based on radio signal strength analysis  spoton researchers designed and built hardware that serves as object location tags  in the spoton approach  objects are located by homogenous sensor nodes without central control  i.e  ad hoc manner  spoton tags use received rss value as 1 snaptrack  4 atmel/u-blox  2 atmel 5

wavetrend technologies ltd http  //www.wavetrend  co.za/ 1074 ieee transactions on systems  man  and cyberneticspart c  applications and reviews  vol  37  no  6  november 2007 a sensor measurement for estimating inter-tag distance  they exploit the density of tags and correlation of multiple measurements to improve both accuracy and precision  another system is called landmarc  indoor location sensing using active rfid   29   its prototype uses the rfid readers operating frequency with 308 mhz  in order to increase accuracy without placing more readers  the system employs the idea of having extra fixed location reference tags to help location calibration  these reference tags serve as reference points in the system  the landmarc approach requires signal strength information from each tag to readers  the knn method is adopted to calculate the location of the rfid tags  it is reported that the 50 percentile has an error distance of around 1 m while the maximum error distances are less than 2 m for landmarc system  c cellular-based a number of systems have used global system of mobile/code division multiple access  gsm/cdma  mobile cellular network to estimate the location of outdoor mobile clients  however  the accuracy of the method using cell-id or enhanced observed time difference  e-otd  is generally low  in the range of 50200 m   depending on the cell size  generally speaking  the accuracy is higher in densely covered areas  e.g  urban places  and much lower in rural environments  30   indoor positioning based on mobile cellular network is possible if the building is covered by several base stations or one base station with strong rss received by indoor mobile clients  otsasen et al  presented a gsm-based indoor localization system in  31   their key idea that makes accurate gsm-based indoor localization possible is the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints  the wide fingerprint includes the six strongest gsm cells and readings of up to 29 additional gsm channels  most of which are strong enough to be detected but too weak to be used for efficient communication  the higher dimensionality introduced by the additional channel dramatically increases localization accuracy  they present results for experiments conducted on signal-strength fingerprints collected from three multifloor buildings using weighted knn technique  the results show that their indoor localization system can differentiate between floors and achieve median within-floor accuracy as low as 2.5 m the same method could be applied in is-95 cdma and 3g mobile network  d uwb uwb is based on sending ultrashort pulses  typically < 1 ns   with a low duty cycle  typically 1  1000   on the spectral domain  the system  thus  uses an uwb  even > 500 mhz wide   uwb location has the following advantages  32   unlike conventional rfid systems  which operate on single bands of the radio spectrum  uwb transmits a signal over multiple bands of frequencies simultaneously  from 3.1 to 10.6 ghz  uwb signals are also transmitted for a much shorter duration than those used in conventional rfid  uwb tags consume less power than conventional rf tags and can operate across a broad area of the radio spectrum  uwb can be used in close proximity to other rf signals without causing or suffering from interference because of the differences in signal types and radio spectrum used  uwb short duration pulses are easy to filter in order to determine which signals are correct and which are generated from multipath  at the same time  the signal passes easily through walls  equipment and clothing  however metallic and liquid materials cause uwb signal interference  use of more uwb readers and strategic placement of uwb readers could overcome this disadvantage  short-pulse waveforms permit an accurate determination of the precise toa and  namely  the precise tof of a burst transmission from a short-pulse transmitter to a corresponding receiver  33    32   uwb location exploits the characteristics of time synchronization of uwb communication to achieve very high indoor location accuracy  20 cm   so it is suitable for high-precision real-time 2-d and 3-d location  3-d location positioning can be performed by using two different measuring means  tdoa  which is measuring the time difference between a uwb pulse arriving at multiple sensors  and aoa  the advantage of using both means in conjunction is that a location can be determined from just two sensors decreasing the required sensor density over systems that just use tdoa  more uwb knowledge and products are given in7 and their related references  to date  several uwb precision localization systems have been fielded  34  .8  9  10 the ubisense system8 is a unidirectional uwb location platform with a conventional bidirectional time division multiple access  tdma  control channel  the tags transmit uwb signals to networked receivers and are located using aoa and tdoa  ubisense works by creating sensor cells  each cell requires at least four sensors or readers  throughout buildings or collections of buildings  an unlimited number of readers can be networked together in a manner similar to cellular phone networks  the readers receive data from the tags  from as far as 150 ft  and send it through the ubisense smart space software platform  microwave frequency  covered by the uwb frequency band  is used in siemens local position radar  lpr   24   siemens lpr is an rtof system  in which the rtof between a transponder unit and measuring units/base stations is measured via the frequency modulated continuous wave  fmcw  radar principle  it was launched for industrial applications like crane and forklift positioning  it is applicable only for los environment  e wlan  ieee 802.11  this midrange wireless local area network  wlan  standard  operating in the 2.4-ghz industrial  scientific and medical  ism  band  has become very popular in public hotspots and enterprise locations during the last few years  with a typical gross bit rate of 11  54  or 108 mbps and a range of 50100 m  ieee 802.11 is currently the dominant local wireless networking standard  it is  therefore  appealing to use an existing wlan infrastructure for indoor location as well  by adding a location 7 intel corporation  http  //www.intel.com/technology/comms/uwb/  and ultrawideband planet

 survey of wireless indoor positioning techniques and systems server  the accuracy of typical wlan positioning systems using rss is approximatly 3 to 30 m  with an update rate in the range of few seconds  bahl et al   35  proposed an in-building user location and tracking systemradar  which adopts the nearest neighbor  s  in signal-space technique  which is the same as the knn  the authors proposed two kinds of approaches to determine the user location  the first one depends on the empirical measurement of access point signal strength in offline phase  by these experiments  it is reported that user orientations  number of nearest neighbors used  number of data points  and number of samples in real-time phase would affect the accuracy of location determination  the second one is signal propagation modeling  wall attenuation factor  waf  and floor attenuation factor  faf  propagation model is used  instead of rayleigh fading model and rician distribution model  which are used in outdoor situation  waf takes into consideration the number of walls  obstructions   the accuracy of radar system is about 23 m in their following work  36   radar was enhanced by a viterbi-like algorithm  its result is that the 50 percentile of the radar system is around 2.372.65 m and its 90 percentile is around 5.935.97 m horus system  37    38  offered a joint clustering technique for location estimation  which uses the probabilistic method described previously  each candidate location coordinate is regarded as a class or category  in order to minimize the distance error  location li is chosen while its likelihood is the highest  the experiment results show that this technique can acquire an accuracy of more than 90 % to within 2.1 m increasing the number of samples at each sampling location could improve its accuracy because increasing the number of samples would improve the estimation for means and standard deviations of gaussian distribution  roos et al   39  developed a grid-based bayesian location-sensing system over a small region of their office building  achieving localization and tracking to within 1.5 m over 50 % of the time  nibble  40   one of the first systems of this generation  used a probabilistic approach  based on bayesian network  to estimate a devices location  in  41   battiti et al  proposed a location determination method by using neural-network-based classifier  they adopted multilayer perceptron  mlp  architecture and one-step secant  oss  training method  they chose the three-layer architecture with three input units  eight hidden layer units  and two outputs  since this architecture could acquire the lowest training and testing error  and it is less sensitive to the overfitting effect  they reported that only five samples of signal strengths in different locations are sufficient to get an average distance error of 3 m increasing the number of training examples helps decrease the average distance error to 1.5 m the authors in  42  compared the neural-networks-based classifier with the nearest neighbor classifier and probabilistic method  it is reported in  42  that neural networks give an error of 1 m with 72 % probability  wireless location-sensing is actually a specialized case of a well-studied problem in mobile robotics  that of robot localizationdetermining the position of a mobile robot given inputs from the robots various sensors  possibly including gps  1075 sonar  vision  and ultrasound sensors   robot-based or trackingassisting wireless localization has been studied by many researchers  43   ladd et al   44    45  propose a grid-based bayesian robot localization algorithm that uses the ieee 802.11 infrastructure  in the first step of the algorithm  a host uses a probabilistic model to compute the likelihood of its location for a number of different locations  based on the rss from nine aps  the second step exploits the limited maximum speed of mobile users to refine the results  of the first step  and reject solutions with significant change in the location of the mobile host  depending on whether the second step is used or not  83 % and 77 % of the time  hosts can predict their location within 1.5 m haeberlen et al   46  presented a practical robust bayesian method for topological localization over the entirety of an 802.11 network deployed within a multistorey office building  they have shown that the use of a topological model can dramatically reduce the time required to train the localizer  while the resulting accuracy is still sufficient for many location-aware applications  siddiqi et al   47  used monte carlo localization technique  and obtained similar result to that of  44   kontkanen et al  also introduced a tracking-assistant positioning system  48   this system was used to develop the ekahau system,11 a commercial wireless location-sensing system that combines bayesian networks  stochastic complexity and online competitive learning  to provide positioning information through a central location server  in  49   xiang et al  proposed a model-based signal propagation distribution training scheme and a tracking-assistant positioning algorithm in which a state machine is used to adaptively transfer between tracking and nontracking status to achieve more accuracy  this system is reported to achieve 2 m accuracy with 90 % probability for static position determination  for a walking mobile device  5 m accuracy with 90 % probability is achieved  while most systems based on wlan are using signal strength  aeroscout  formerly bluesoft   50  uses 802.11-based tdoa location solution  it requires the same radio signal to be received at three or more separate points  timed very accurately  to a few nanoseconds  and processed using the tdoa algorithm to determine the location  there are several other location systems using wlan  7    51   54   for space limitations  we do not discuss their details here  f bluetooth  ieee 802.15  bluetooth operates in the 2.4-ghz ism band  compared to wlan  the gross bit rate is lower  1 mbps   and the range is shorter  typically 1015 m   on the other hand  bluetooth is a lighter standard  highly ubiquitous  embedded in most phones  personal digital assistants  pdas   etc   and supports several other networking services in addition to ip  bluetooth tags are small size transceivers  as any other bluetooth device  each tag has a unique id  this id can be used for locating the bluetooth tag   74   the bluetags tag is a typical bluetooth tag.12 11

 positioning server  s   wireless access points  and wireless tags  the systems performance makes it suitable for tracking humans and assets  this system provides roomwise accuracy  or  alternatively  2-m spatial accuracy   with 95 % reliability  the positioning delay is 1530 s the performance is further enhanced in their new generation topaz system that integrates infrared and other transducers  with the bluetooth positioning and communication capabilities  antti et al  present the design and implementation of a bluetooth local positioning application  blpa   55   first  they convert the received signal power levels to distance estimates according to a simple propagation model  and then  they use the extended kalman filter  ekf  to compute 3-d position estimate on the basis of distance estimates  the accuracy of blpa is reported to be 3.76 m a similar work has been done by hallberg et al   56   g others 1  proprietary solutions using ultra high frequency  uhf   the uhf location systems operate  typically either at the 433-mhz band  medical telemetry  or at the 868-mhz and 2.4-ghz ism band  at such frequency ranges  walls have a moderate attenuation  some proprietary solutions such as the 3-d-id system from pinpoint  57  or the tdoa system from wherenet14 have similar performance as the wlan systems mentioned later  however  the specially designed hardware and a protocol with longer power down periods allows for minimal power consumption in the mobile  for example  wherenet  a real-time locating system  rtls   uses the same 2.4 ghz band as the ieee 802.11 and bluetooth systems  but it uses a dedicated standard protocol  ansi 371.1  optimized for low-power spread-spectrum location  it works by timing the signals transmitted from tags to a network of receivers  3d-id is a commercial location system produced by pinpoint  pinpoint uses rtof to do ranging  it uses an installed array of antennas at known positions to perform multilateration  when a mobile tag receives a broadcast  the tag immediately rebroadcasts it on a different frequency  modulated with the tags identifier  a cell controller cycles through the antennas  collecting a set of ranges to the tag  using a 40 mhz signal  this system achieves a 30-m range  1-m precision  and 5-s location update rate  commercial indoor positioning systems using mesh network techniques such as meshnetwork positioning system  mps  15 are also worth to mention  the mps technology leverages the patented position location and determination methods built into meshnetwork quadrature division multiple access  qdma  radio technology  which uses direct sequence spread spectrum  dsss  and operates in the ism 2.4-ghz bands  it is reported that mps position location information  accurate to within 10 m  is generated in less than 1 s at mobility speeds of up to 200 mi/h  2  positioning using multiple media  designing a location system for a single environment presents difficulties when the system is applied to other environments  to successfully bridge the differences among different types of sensors and overcome the limitations of a single type of positioning sensor  hybrid systems attempt to compensate for the shortcomings of a single technology by using multiple sensor types  hp labs smartlocus  58  uses synchronized rf and ultrasound differential time-of-flight measurements to determine the internodal range between any two nodes  hp labs researchers developed several techniques to create relative coordinate geometries with little user intervention  to create an absolute frame of reference and tie internodal topology to building geometry  a minimum of three or four nodes  for 2-d or 3-d localizations  must be preassigned to suitable fixed locations  all the remaining nodes are free to move  and locations are continuously updated and known to the rest of the system  the well-known cricket indoor location system also uses rf and ultrasound media  59   infrared radiation  ir  wireless is the use of wireless technology in devices or systems that convey data through infrared radiation  ir is used in wireless personal area network  wpan  since it is a short-range narrow-transmission-angle beam suitable for aiming and selective reception of signals  most of the infrared data association  irda  wireless system is based on the los mode  considering the high room accuracy of the ir location  60   and the high availability of the uhf location  it makes sense to combine the two methods into a hybrid location system  several other companies like radianse16 and versus17 use a combination of rf and ir signals to perform location positioning  their tags emit ir and rf signals containing a unique identifier for each person or asset being tracked  the use of rf allows coarse-grain positioning  e.g  floor  while the ir signals provide additional resolution  e.g  room   the eiris local positioning system18 uses an irfid triple technology that combines ir  rf  uhf   and lf  rf low-frequency transponder  signals  it combines the advantages of each technology  i.e  the room location of ir  the wide range of rf  and the tailored range sensitivity of lf  however  comparing to rf and ir hybrid system  it could be more costly  3  positioning using cordless phone system  cordless phone system is a modern wireless communication

reviews  vol  37  no  6  november 2007 wireless sensor networks in a wide variety of applications  including indoor location positioning  65   such systems using wireless sensor network have been described as cooperative  relative  multi-hop  gps-free  or network localization ; ad-hoc or sensor positioning ; and self-localization in various papers  communication and measurements between many pairs of sensors are required to achieve localization for all sensors  we refer the readers to  14  for more details about cooperative localization  up to now  two major sensor network standards are the ieee 802.15.4 physical  phy  layer and medium access control  mac  layer standard for low-rate wireless personal-area networks  lr-wpans   and the zigbee networking and application layer standard  67   these standards allow for localization information to be measured between pairs of sensors  in particular  rss can be measured in the 802.15.4 phy standard via the link quality indication  lqi   which reports the signal strength associated with a received packet to higher layers  most of the sensor-network-based location estimations use rss measurement  68    69   some systems also use toa

are mainly the ones whose specifications have been reported by their developers  we have excluded the cases in which little or no information on them has been made available  v conclusion and future trends this paper surveys the current indoor positioning techniques and systems  different performance measurement criteria are discussed and several tradeoffs among them are observed  for example  the one between complexity and accuracy/precision needs careful consideration when we choose positioning systems and techniques for different applications environments such as warehousing  robotics  or emergency  usually  location fingerprinting scheme is better for open areas while active rfid is suitable for dense environments  in terms of scalability and availability  these positioning techniques and systems have their own important characteristics when applied in real environments  the choice of technique and technology significantly affects the granularity and accuracy of the location information  future trends of wireless indoor positioning systems are as follows  1  new or hybrid position algorithms are needed  a few of the works have already been started supporting such algorithms  for example  a calibration-free location algorithm based on triangulation  triangular interpolation and extrapolation  tix   is introduced in  75   a hybrid algorithm is presented in  76  for indoor positioning using wlan that aims to combine the benefits of the rf propagation loss model and fingerprinting method  the same work has been done in  77   the selective fusion location estimation  selfloc   72  algorithm infers the user location by selectively fusing location information from multiple wireless technologies and/or multiple classical location algorithms in a theoretically optimal manner  2  internetworking of different wireless positioning systems is a research and practical topic in order to extend the positioning range  3  wireless combined with other technologies such as optical  e.g  ir   inertial  dc electromagnetic and ultrasonic for indoor location is another trend  how to combine these technologies into a practical system is a topic of sensor fusion  4  how to deploy sensors to improve the positioning accuracy  how to finish deploying wireless positioning system in a short time  especially for emergency responder application is also worth considering  73   5  wireless indoor location using uwb  from 3.1 to 10.6 ghz  techniques19 and indoor positioning using mobile cellular network are other promising research topics  31   6  how to integrate indoor and outdoor positioning system is another area of research.20 this integration may help in developing more efficient and robust detection systems for positioning of mobile computing nodes  in this case  a mobile node will be tracked indoor or outdoor using the same detection system  references  1  j hightower and g borriello  location systems for ubiquitous computing computer
