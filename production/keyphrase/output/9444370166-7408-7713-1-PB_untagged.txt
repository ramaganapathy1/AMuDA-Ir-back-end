pulling system with the new mobile based communication system where the loco pilot 's mobile phone number shall be shared with all the passengers through a message  despite the efforts taken to remove the chains from the train  there is a great probability of misuse through the mobile phone number provided  we aim to build a more efficient and secure solution based on the internet of things  which is a buzz word in the market  our proposed system provides an alarm fixed at specific locations in the compartments of a train  in case of emergency  the passenger has to press the alarms ' button  which captures the scene using a built -in digital camera  the system also alarms the loco-pilot  travelling ticket examiner  as well as the compartment so as to provide immediate possible help through the fellow co-passengers  the pilot slows down the train to an optimum speed whilst the travelling ticket examiner checks and confirms the pilot whether he has to stop the train  the entire system can be controlled through an authenticated mobile application provided to the ticket examiner  the pictures captured by the camera and other crucial details are uploaded to a cloudbased real-time database  thus  saving time and taxpayers ' money as well as helping the railways to perform analytics and come up with feasible solutions to the problems of the passengers  the system has the potential to deal with the most prevailing cargo theft like that of coal  by alerting the staff without having to stop the train  making the convicts ' escapes impossible  this also definitely avoids the improper pulling of chains and thereby not causing any hassle to the passengers as well as diminishes the economic loss to the government by reducing the time delay  keywords  train chain

introduction as a part of the great digital india campaign initiated by honourable prime minister of india  indian railways is extending its digital capabilities to deal with numerous challenges in the network 's daily routine  1   one can call it loud that the indian railways is undergoing a definite transition towards its betterment  digitally  with similar intention  this paper proposes a solution to one such important problem  the emergency train stopping system  the trends in computing and internet of things made this possible  feasible and viable  this is one of the most prevailing problems pertaining the indian railways and is also the main reason for the train delays in many parts the country  the railways updated the old chain pulling system with a mobile-based service that renders the mobile phone numbers of the loco pilots to the passengers through an sms before the start of the train  2   this is not only a distraction to the loco pilot but also raises a chance for miss utilization of the service  which includes prank calling loco pilot after leaving the train  the lack of network coverage along the train routes adds more challenge to the existing loopholes  above all these  someone may not want to carry a phone or may not have a phone  india is yet to get used to this method and problems faced in this system are to be reported  yet  one would probably have a hand full of problems or challenges in this approach  so  the challenge before us is to validate the emergency stop request and take care that the cause to halt the train is unharmed  to put it short and sweet  we are trying to automate the process while not compromising the security and authenticity  received january 2  2017 ; revised april 25  2017 ; accepted may 11  2017 689 issn  2502-4752 1.1 state of the art an analysis of the existing system the proposal is made with an intention to provide a better service to railway passengers  efficiently handling emergency scenarios and reducing the economic loss that is incurred due to the unnecessary halting of the train  3   to achieve this  we plan to establish a secure medium for the train authorities to monitor and communicate with the on-board passengers  hence helping them to take right decisions during critical situations  this not only reduces the loco pilot 's burden but also eliminates the misutilization of loco pilots ' mobile phone number  which is given in public interest  as our system 's network is completely locale to the train  the challenge with network connectivity does not arise  thus  we suggest and provide a stable  reliable and secure system to the railways to carry on its routine without hassle while also considering the economic viability  2 related work 2.1 insights into the working of chain pulling system it has been a long time since the indian railways introduced the chain pulling system in the trains  as the years passed  the need for public transportation increased  to meet the requirements  the railway network along with the number of trains has been dramatically increased  but  the chain pulling mechanism is the only emergency braking system serving the passengers since then  the chain pulling mechanism is entirely mechanical ; its schematic representation as shown in figure 1 the two pipe hoses between every two coaches are for the continual connection of the train compartments  the alarm valve vent as shown in figure 2  which plays a major part in chain pulling system  locks the air from entering the braking system when the chain is pulled  this will initiate a sudden drop in air pressure  hence triggering the brakes  4   figure 1 schematic diagram of the braking system in a moving trains point of view  once the chain is pulled  its associated warning bulb as shown in figure 2 is triggered and the trains is slowed down by a rapid drop in power  the guard at the end of the train can also notice a loss in the brake pressure with the help of a gauge and uses his brakes to help stabilise the train  it is obvious that guard may not be sure about the reason for the loss in air pressure  the loco pilot also gets the information about the air pressure drop and he ensures smooth stopping of the train by his technical skills  the loco pilot has the authority to override an emergency stop request by superseding the alarm chain pull  5   these cases are very rare and usually take place in an abrupt stopping of trains or derailing  usually  the loco pilot gets the information first and notify the tte and the guard by whistling in a two short one long manner  it is pretty much evident from the above complexities that stopping a train is not an easy job and giving unrestricted access to the brakes to all the passengers is something to give a thought to  ijeecs vol  6  no  3  june 2017  688 694 ijeecs issn  2502-4752 690 figure 2 passenger emergency alarm valve  sandip besra  railmaniac  web  21 mar 2017 2.2 major drawbacks of the chain pulling system once the train stops  the guard and onboard crew have to find the compartment with the indicator bulb switched on  this is the compartment where the chain is pulled  the crew has to release a small lever at the brake valve at the end of the coach as shown in figure 3 this whole process has to be done manually as the lever does not come back to its initial position even after the chain is released  alarm and bulb associated will remain active until the lever is reset  6   adding to this the lamps and alarms are controlled by a circuit breaker which has to be taken care of as well  this is one of the main reasons for the huge time delays after a train is halted due to emergency stop  7   this is not required when the train is generally stopped by the loco pilot  hence a huge amount of time  thus money can be saved by making the passengers signal the loco pilot rather than allowing them to stop the train themselves  figure 3 passenger emergency alarm signal device  sandip besra  railmaniac  web  21 mar 2017 hence this system needs a lot of manual intervention say  from the guard  tte and loco pilots  there is no scope to check the validity of the emergency stop request  which really is the root cause of all the challenges  miss-utilization this provision  many passengers indirectly incur huge economic and labour loss  to overcome these complications  the indian railways have come up with a new system where the passengers will be provided with the mobile phone number of the loco pilot and are allowed to contact him in the case of emergencies  the vulnerabilities in this new system include the lack of mobile network connectivity in most of the rail routes and every passenger is expected to possess a mobile all the time  above all the systems scheme adds a lot of work to the already hefty job of the loco pilot  the purview of the misuse is vast and even includes youngsters try to prank the driver  analogous to the chain pulling system  there are a lot of loopholes that should be paid attention to  hence  the change in the system did not bring in as many solutions required  an inventive and innovative alternate for legacy chain pulling system   budaraju sri datta  691 issn  2502-4752 some of the serious challenges indian railways are still facing are as follows  the huge risks of derailing accidents increase when someone tries to stop the train when it is at high speeds  the sudden drop in speed can cause the trail to become unstable  the loco pilot has to put in all his experience and skills to handle the situation from worsening or to prevent the train from derailing at curvatures  8   studies have shown that these chain pulling related accidents have been very adverse always and even the punishments and penalty introduced by the government has not reduced it anyway  another challenge before the railways is the huge goods loss especially that of coal  9   this is mostly observed in rural north india  locals in the areas in jharkhand have been reported for coal theft for years together  coal robbery is a way of life for those people  reports show an estimated 600 crore rupees annual loss due to coal theft in the state of jharkhand alone  10   trains are usually stopped in the middle of jungles and very remote areas and coal units are looted  11   as anybody can stop a moving train in the middle of nowhere  where the train is vulnerable  it does not take much courage for people to turn into robbers  though not everyone will attempt to steal  it is enough if even very few turn robbers  3 architecture of the proposed system to construct the proposed system we make use of interconnected computing units  one can call it iot  internet of things   12   they do the talking to the sensors and actuators of the system  the system includes emergency stop buttons  which alarms the crew as well as the copassengers in that particular compartment  a camera is installed to capture an image of the person who triggered the alarm which  not only serves as a reference for tte to identify but also  as a proof for further official proceedings with the appropriate court of law  the proofs along with other crucial data are then uploaded to cloud servers when the train goes through stations with wi-fi capabilities  the entire system as shown in figure 4 can be controlled by an authenticated android application which is to be possessed by the tte  the cloud resources can be accessed from anywhere by the railways  figure 4 proposed implementation strategy 4 functioning of the proposed system the proposed system comprises of three major units  first being the input  second being the control unit and third being the storage unit  all the units coordinate and make the infallible workflow possible  the brief explanation of each unit is as follows  figure 5   figure 5 core units of the system ijeecs vol  6  no  3  june 2017  688 694 ijeecs issn  2502-4752 692 4.1 input unit the stop button  camera and the alarm are controlled by the computing device as shown in figure 6  which is supervised by on-board staff using an android application  the application is authenticated to ensure security  all the devices mentioned above are powered by the computing device itself  which in turn  draws power from the train  the embedded system and all the peripherals connected to it consume very low power  figure 6 prototype of the proposed system the raspberry pi 3  which is the computing system of our board  is powered by a +5.1v micro usb supply channel as portrayed in figure 7 we have found that a 2.5a power supply will provide ample power to run the system  this small amount of power can be easily taken from the surplus power of the train  figure 7 schematics of raspberry pi 3 b gpio schematics  raspberry pi documentation  raspberrypi.org  n.p  2017 web  21 mar  2017  4.2 control unit this core unit comprises of multiple raspberry pis  which are a single board computers  they are pre-programmed and are interconnected among themselves as well as with the authenticated devices the ttes carry  the devices use an android application that lets the raspberry pi to share control and information with the tte through a secured channel  the information includes the pictures of the passenger like in the figure 8  who triggered the alarm along with other vital information retrieved from the system 's sensors  an inventive and innovative alternate for legacy chain pulling system   budaraju sri datta  693 issn  2502-4752 figure 8 sample picture captured from the camera module 4.3 storage unit all the collected resources are primarily stored in the computing devices internal memory  the viable data from the sensors and the data collected by the tte after any valid case are tagged and stored  such crucial information is then uploaded to cloud storage when goes through railway stations with wi-fi capabilities  thankfully the indian railways have provided wi-fi facility in most of the busy railway stations  13   hence  facilitating the authorities to perform analytics and come up with feasible solutions to the problems of the passengers  5 application workflow for the effective functioning of the proposed system  the crew and the passengers should follow the below mentioned protocol  in the case of emergency  the passenger has to press the alarms button  which captures the scene using a built-in digital camera  the system then alarms the loco pilot and the tte as well as the compartment so as to provide immediate help possible through the fellow co-passengers  meanwhile  the loco pilot has to slow down the train to an optimum speed whilst the tte checks and confirms the loco pilot whether he has to stop the train  the entire system is controlled through an authenticated mobile application provided to the tte  the pictures captured by the camera and other crucial details are uploaded to a cloud-based real-time database as depicted in the figure 9  14   figure 9 proposed workflow ijeecs vol  6  no  3  june 2017  688 694 ijeecs issn  2502-4752 694 6 vast scope for advancements there is a lot of scope to improve its working  and can make the product cheaper  compact and durable  more smartness can be brought in with rapidly growing iot technologies  the same can be made mandatory in all trains in india  ensuring to provide the best care to all the citizens  centralised data monitoring and analytics can be carried out to identify patterns and work upon it to improvise the network  also  better image processing algorithms can be used towards identification and retrieval for the human faces  15  16   7 conclusion this system comprising of raspberry pi  its peripherals and an android application  provides a secure and efficient emergency stopping procedure  this helps the railway staff to have better control during emergencies  as this is simple and inexpensive this can be immediately implemented in the regions where the chain pulling cases are the highest  hence through this approach we could prevent wastage of both railways and taxpayers ' time and money  references
