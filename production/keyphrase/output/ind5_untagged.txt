@ us.ibm.com abstract  asset tracking knowing what you have and where it is located is essential for the smooth operation of many enterprises  from manufacturers  distributors  and retailers of consumer goods  to government departments  enterprises of all kinds are gearing up to use rfid technology to increase the visibility of goods and assets within their supply chain and on their premises  however  rfid technology alone lacks the capability to track the location of items once they are moved within a facility  this paper presents a prototype automatic location sensing system that combines rfid technology and off-the-shelf wi-fi based continuous positioning technology for asset tracking in indoor environments  the system employs a robot  with an attached rfid reader  which periodically crawls the space  associating items it detects with its own location determined with the wi-fi positioning system  we propose three algorithms that combine the detected tags reading with previous samples to compute its location  our experiments have shown that our positioning algorithms can bring a two to three fold improvement on the raw accuracy provided by the positioning technology  1 introduction consider a typical public library  each book has its own place in a particular shelf  usually  readers like to take several books  from different shelves  and browse through them until they find the right book  while some readers manage to return the unwanted books to the correct shelf  many of them either leave the books in some corner of the library or place them back in the wrong location  this latter situation is hard to detect and can become a librarians nightmare  a similar situation exists in many retail stores where the customers can tryout several items before deciding which one to buy  in most cases  the customer never returns the tested item to its correct shelf  some kind of automated tracking mechanism is required  the problem of asset tracking is not restricted to libraries or small retail stores  many companies are realizing the importance of increasing the visibility within their supply chain  asset tracking knowing what you have and where it is located is essential for the smooth operation of large manufacturing companies  it also helps big retailers  like wal-mart  isolate bottlenecks in their supply 1 chain  reduce overstocking or locate spoiled cargo  several government and military organizations are always on the lookout for cheaper  and more efficient  ways to track their assets and equipment  automatic location sensing is the key to enabling such tracking applications  one of the most wellknow positioning systems is gps  16   which relies on satellites to track location  however  due to its dependence on the satellites  gps lacks the ability to accurately determine location inside buildings  in order to achieve location tracking inside buildings  researchers and industry have proposed several systems  which differ with respect to the technology used  accuracy  coverage  frequency of updates and the cost of installation and maintenance  22   2   25   4   14   6   20   23   triangulation  scene analysis  and proximity are the three principal techniques for automatic location-sensing  18   steggles and cadman  24  provide a good comparison of various rf-tag-based location sensing technologies  many of the current location sensing systems are radio based  wi-fi   14   23   26   5   1   bluetooth   3   1    by using base station visibility and signal strength or time of flight  it is possible to locate wi-fi devices with an accuracy of several meters  in recent years  rfid technology has attracted considerable attention  rfid is emerging as an important technology that is reshaping supply chain management  rfid not only replaces the old barcode technology but also provides a greater degree of flexibility in terms of range and access mechanisms  for example  an rfid scanner can read the encoded information even if the tag is concealed  this might be for either aesthetic or security reasons   several companies  like wal-mart  gillette  cvs etc  are proposing to use rfid for identifying large lots of goods at pallet and carton level  usually passive tags are preferred for tagging goods as they are much cheaper  long lived  lightweight and have a smaller foot print  however since passive tags work without a battery  they have a very small detection range  current rfid systems are portal based where tagged items are scanned either when they enter or leave a facility  this scheme does not provide any information about the exact location of the item once it is moved away from the portal  the prototype system described in this paper combines  passive  rfid technology and a wi-fi  802.11b  based continuous location positioning system to provide a periodic asset-locating sweep  although  our system uses wi-fi based location positioning  it can work with any continuous positioning technology  the prototype system not only identifies but also provides location information of every rfid-tagged item in the sweep space  a portable system  e.g  laptop or pda  running a wi-fi client and connected to an rf reader is mounted on a robot that moves autonomously through the space  as the robot moves  the rf reader periodically samples which tags are detectable  at each sample time  the robots position is obtained from the positioning system  for each detected tag  given the estimate of the robots current position  knowledge of the readers physical detection range  and the robots position 2 estimates at previous detections  an algorithm computes an estimate of the tags position  in summary  our experiments with the prototype system show that we are able to estimate positions of tagged entities to within 1.5m  given an accuracy of the raw positioning system of about 4m  we experimented with different position estimation algorithms and found that certain algorithms work better than others when the raw positioning system is capable of giving better accuracy  the rest of the paper is structured as follows  in section 2  we survey related work in the area of location tracking in indoor environments  section 3 briefly describes rfid technology and its use in our project  section 4 explains the wi-fi positioning system and our experience with its performance  in section 5 we present results of experiments carried out using our prototype system  and our algorithms   finally  section 6 concludes the paper and presents directions for future research  2 related work researchers and industry have proposed several location-sensing systems  which differ with respect to technology used  accuracy  coverage  frequency of updates and the cost of installation and maintenance  some of these systems suffer from disadvantages that limit their use  for example  infrared systems  25  have line of sight restriction ; ultrasonic systems  2   4  are accurate but expensive  recently  there has been an increase in the number of wireless companies that are seeking newer ways to track people and things in indoor environment  the rest of this section gives a brief description of several indoor location sensing technologies and various companies that make use of these technologies for asset tracking in indoor environment  some of the earlier attempts for location sensing used infrared  ir  technology  active badge  developed at olivetti research laboratory  now at & t cambridge   used diffuse infrared technology  25  to realize indoor location positioning  the line-of-sight requirement and short-range signal transmission are two major limitations that suggest it to be less than effective in practice for indoor location sensing  more recently  the focus has moved to using radio frequency  rf  signals rf-ir combination or ultrasonic  in case of rf  techniques such as differential time of arrival or simple signal strength measurement at various sensors are employed  radar is an rf based system for locating and tracking users inside buildings  14   using a standard 802.11 network adapter to measure signal strengths at multiple base stations positioned to provide overlapping coverage in a given area  this system combines empirical measurements and signal propagation modeling in order to determine user location thereby enabling location-aware services and applications  wherenet  13  on the other hand works by timing signals transmitted from tags to a network of receivers  it uses the same 2.4ghz band as the 802.11 and bluetooth systems  but it uses a dedicated standard protocol  ansi 371.1  optimized for low 3 power spread-spectrum location  aeroscout  formerly bluesoft  uses 802.11-based time difference of arrival  tdoa  location solution  it requires the same radio signal to be received at three or more separate points  timed very accurately  to a few nanoseconds  and processed using the tdoa algorithm to determine the location  ekahau  5  wi-fi positioning system computes the location of a client device by applying a probabilistic model to the signal strength measured at the wi-fi client device  unlike aeroscout  and other tdoa based systems   the indoor environment has to be calibrated so that the positioning engine get a signal strength map of the room  ekahau tags  or wi-fi devices running ekahau client  constantly send their signal strength measure to the positioning engine which keeps track of each devices location  several other companies like radianse  9  and versus  12  use a combination of rf and ir signals to do location positioning  their tags emit if and rf signals containing a unique identifier for each person or asset being tracked  the use of rf allows coarse-grain positioning  e.g  floor  while the ir signals provide additional resolution  e.g  room   the cricket location support system  4  and active bat location system  2  are two primary examples that use the ultrasonic technology  normally  these systems use an ultrasound time-of-flight measurement technique to provide location information  most of them share a significant advantage  which is the overall accuracy  cricket for example can accurately delineate 4x4 square-feet regions within a room while active bat can locate bats to within 9cm of their true position for 95 percent of the measurements  ultra wideband  or uwb  is a new technology that has entered the arena of indoor location sensing  unlike conventional rf systems  uwb systems are much less affected by multipath distortion  the ubisense  11  system uses uwb and is based on time of arrival rather than signal strength and claims to have an accuracy of 6 inches  15 cm  in 3d space at a confidence level of 95 %  the system uses uwb tags  called ubitags   which are fixed to the items being tracked  discussion the asset tracking technologies mentioned above are mostly geared towards tracking items that individually have high value  e.g  emergency medical equipment or an important person a surgeon   these items require continuous tracking and justify the use of expensive tracking equipment  however  in many tracking applications  e.g  the library scenario described earlier  the object being tracked is either too small or too low value to justify the use of a tracking system with high per-item cost  and in fact  many of these applications do not require continuous tracking  we believe there are many applications where it is valuable to know the precise location of an asset  yet it is permissible for an assets location to an informative web site on uwb is provided by multispectral solutions  inc  8  4 be updated on a periodic basisnightly  for example  our bluebot system is targeted towards such applications  we can characterize different tracking technologies by distinguishing between continuity in space and continuity in time  as illustrated in table 1 a technology that provides space-continuous position estimates is able to provide a position estimate that falls anywhere in space  that may or may not be accurate   gps is an example  a technology that provides time-continuous position estimates is able to provide position estimates at any point in time  intervals between estimates limited only by the performance of the system   most positioning technologies are continuous in both space and time  an example that is continuous in time but not in space is cell-id  i.e  reporting the location of an entity as that of the wireless base station it is communicating with  the location is known to be somewhere in the coverage region of the base station but at no greater resolution than that  an example that is neither continuous in space nor in time is a typical rfid deployment  such as the ez-pass toll collection system  where the location of a tagged item is known only at the times that item passes near a reader  we believe that the system discussed in this paper  bluebot  represents a new point in this taxonomy  which provides position estimates continuous in space but not in time  as such  it points the way to tracking solutions that provide the precise location estimates needed by some applications  but  by sacrificing continuity in time  at a much lower cost  table 1  tracking systems taxonomy continuous in space continuous in time yes yes gps  tdoa  eotd  no simple presence technologies wi-fi signal strength  etc   e.g  cellular system where cellid is reported as the cellphones location  bluebot fixed beacon  e.g  ezpass  bluetooth  no 3 rfid technology rfid  radio frequency identification  technology has attracted considerable attention in the recent past  15   government organizations  especially the military  and several companies  i.e  wal-mart  gillette  cvs etc  have been investing heavily in rfid technology to increase the transparency of their supply chain and to provide asset tracking on their premises  there are several advantages of using rfid 5 technology no contact and non-line-of-sight  working under harsh environmental conditions  etc  rfid systems have a fast response time and in some cases tags can be read in less than a 100 milliseconds  the other advantages are their promising transmission range and cost-effectiveness  rfid tags can be concealed for either aesthetic or security reasons and yet be detected by an rfid reader  rfid tags are categorized as either passive or active  passive rfid tags usually operate without a battery and offer a virtually unlimited operational lifetime  they reflect the rf signal transmitted to them from a reader and add information by modulating the reflected signal  passive tags are much lighter and less expensive than active tags  however  ranges of more than 1.5m are not easily achieved using passive tags  active tags contain both a radio transceiver and a 2-5 year battery to power the transceiver  since there is an onboard radio  active tags have more range than passive tags  30m or more   however  they are more expensive and have a larger physical footprint compared to passive tags  0.5m 4 ft figure 1  intermec pcmcia reader and passive tag  figure 2  rf characteristic of reader antenna  in our system  we use the intermec  7  pcmcia rfid reader  figure 1   which operates at a frequency of 915mhz  the reader can be connected to any device that has a pcmcia port  in our experiments  we had the reader connected to a laptop pc  but a smaller device  such as a pda  or a custom-built pc  can be used as well for additional portability  the reader is attached to a directional antenna  which has a very short range  5 feet max   the readers antenna is placed facing the ceiling such that its maximum gain is in the vertical direction  the rf characteristics of the reader would approximate a vertical cone with its vertex on the readers antenna  we observed that tags at a height of 4 feet were detected with 90 %  or higher  probability when the reader was  horizontally  within 0.5m of the tag  figure 2   due to the rectangular base of the readers antenna  the rf characteristics had an elliptical 6 shape  with the larger axis along the longer sides of the rectangle   however  we found that the eccentricity was close to 1 for all our experiments we have considered the readers rf characteristics to be a circle  4 wi-fi positioning system we use an off-the-shelf wi-fi  802.11b  positioning system to track our client system  consisting of the rfid reader  client machine and the robot  figure 8   the positioning system computed the location by using signal strength information  as perceived by the client device being tracked   the positioning engine advertised an average accuracy of 1m  3.5 ft   4.1 calibration figure 3  asymmetric coverage improves positioning systems accuracy  the positioning system we used needs to be calibrated before location scanning can begin  the calibration process establishes an rf-signal strength plot of the area into the positioning systems engine  the calibration process involves drawing a series of straight lines on the area map and recording sample points signal strength at a given location along the line  while at a particular location  the recording device  client device e.g  laptop/pda wirelessly connected to the positioning engine  is turned around 360 to record the signals from all directions  several sample points are taken at 3-5m intervals along the lines  the calibration process is repeated until the entire area is covered  in general  a higher number of calibration points give better accuracy  since the wi-fi system that we used was signal strength based  any major change in the environmental conditions in the room  e.g  moving of office partition  metal shelves/cupboards  required re-calibration to ensure maximum accuracy  the calibration process needs to be repeated if an access points are added  removed or moved from the calibrated area  there are some simple techniques to improve the overall accuracy of the system  one such technique is to avoid 7 symmetric coverage within a room  for example  using two omnidirectional access points for coverage in an open room can cause a symmetric rf pattern  as a result  there would be two or more sample points that would record the same signal strength pattern from the two aps  figure 3a   using aps with directional antennas or having an asymmetric coverage by introducing a third access point  aps at 3 corners of the room  figure 3b  can solve this problem  4.2 positioning technology accuracy analysis because our tag-position estimation algorithms  described later  use characteristics of the positioning technology used to position the robot  we carried out two sets of experiments to examine the performance of our positioning system  the two sets differed in the density of calibration points and the size of the experiment area  4.2.1 case a 12.5m  500 in  room entrance 43 37 31 25 19 13 7 ap 1 1 2 13.75m  550 in  carpeted area 3 foosball table 4 5 chess board ap 3 ap 2 48 42 36 30 24 18 12 6 figure 4  experiment setup  case a  the experiment area chosen was a large open 12.5m x 13.75m room  figure 4   the positioning system was calibrated to work with only the three access points that were installed in the room  during the calibration process  the positioning engine was programmed to ignore any other access points installed in 8 the building   the calibration points were spaced at a distance of approximately three meters  the three access points were powered down to run at 15mw  to improve accuracy of the system  we wanted to have the access point coverage such it gives the steepest signal strength gradient across the room  our cisco 340 access points had four power levels  100mw  30mw  15mw and 5mw   using the positioning systems software  we found that 5mw power level didnt give complete coverage in the room which resulted in a higher error  we selected 15mw which seemed to give the best gradient  after the calibration process  48 points  refer figure 4  were chosen as sample locations in an approximate area of 9m x 12m  an 801.11b client device was moved to each of the sample locations and positioning system was queried to report the position of the client  this process was repeated at four different times during the day with varying conditions in the room  e.g  people playing foosball or having a discussion on the couch  etc   the positioning systems api gave us the x  y coordinates of the client and an error estimate e in meters  in general it can be observed that the error distance is more for points near the wall  e.g  sample points 1-6 and multiples of 6 6  12  18   there is no definite pattern for the error estimate values  figure 5 gives the mean and variance of the error distance and error estimate for each of the sample points  table 2 shows the mean  and variance  error distance  the positioning systems expected error  for this setup  our experiments showed that the average positioning error  for the positioning system  was between 3.5-4 meters for this setup  mean/variance of

room  see figure 6   unlike case a  the calibration points in this experiment were closely 9 spaced  1m   the rest of the calibration setup  position of access points and their power level  was the same as case a after the calibration process  21 points  refer figure 6  were chosen as sample points  we followed the same procedure as described in case a the wi-fi client device was moved to each of the sample points and positioning engine was queried to report the location of the client  the process was repeated at four different times during the day with varying conditions in the room   the error distance and the error estimate values are much lower in this case  compared to case a  probably because the area is better calibrated  densely spaced calibration points   the error values are higher near the edges of the experiment area where there is uneven  and less dense  distribution of calibration points  figure 7 gives the mean and variance of the error distance and error estimate

samples for a particular tag during robots random walk  our system uses the roomba robotic floorvac  10  as the robot that moves autonomously in the sweep space  the roomba uses intelligent navigation technology to automatically move around the room without any human direction  the roomba expects to cover 90 % of the room  a server machine running the positioning engine  pe  tracks our client device  laptop/pda  that sits on the robot  figure 8 depicts the bluebot setup  the pe is calibrated to work with the access points placed in the corners of the 11 experiment room  case b   the rfid reader is connected to the client device and records all the tags that it detects as the roomba moves to different corners of the room  in our experiments  the tagged items were placed at a height of approximately 4ft from the ground  whenever the reader detects a tag  the client machine sends a message containing the tags id to the server  the server then notes the current position of the client and associates it with the detected tag  our algorithms combine this sample with the previous samples to refine the position of the tagged item over time  as seen from figure 9  a tag will be sampled only when the rf-reader enters its coverage area  figure 10 gives a logical flow chart of the system  it should be noted that due to the random movement of the robot  consecutive samples for the same tag might not be equally spaced in time  experimental results in later section confirm this  algorithm for computing the location of tagged items tagid  robots position  timestamp  sample no  visible tags software current location rf reader client rf reader hardware position determination technology location sensing system robot figure 10  logical flowchart of the robotic crawler system  5.2 algorithms as mentioned before  the positioning system reported the x  y coordinates and an error estimate ee in meters  we have seen before that the rf characteristics of the reader are in the form of a cone expanding outwards in the vertical direction  with the tags placed at 4ft from the ground  the readers detection circle was determined to have a radius  r  close to 0.25m  a circle drawn with center at  x  y  and radius  r  of ee+r  figure 11  will include the tag being tracked  we call this circle the confidence circle  we define the following  t represents the tag with id t nt is the total number of samples for a given tag  t  xti  yti  is the location estimate for sample i of tag t 12 eeti is the error estimate for the positioning report for sample i of tag t r is a constant representing the read radius of the rfid reader  rti = eeti + r  is the radius of the confidence circle for sample i for tag t c   xti  yti   rti   is the confidence circle for sample i of tag t with these in mind  we provide three algorithms to compute the location  intersection algorithm  intersection of several confidence circles provides a finer estimate of a tags position  we represent the tags location as the centroid of the bounding box of this intersection area  as the number of samples increases  the intersection area decreases  figure 12   thus improving the accuracy of the  tags  calculated location  the estimate location then is   xt  yt  = centroid  boundingbox  c   xt1  yt1   r1  c   xt2  yt2   rt2   c   xnt  ynt   rnt    the precision of this algorithm is inversely proportional to the size of the intersection region  smaller intersections imply higher probability distribution  figure 11  total radius is the sum of the reader coverage and the uncertainty circle  error estimate circle   figure 12  intersection of the different sample circles converges to the tag location  not all confidence circles are shown in the figure   weighted averages  here we create an algorithm that computes the location coordinates of the tagged entity as a weighted average of the readers locations when it detected the entity  the weight of each location estimate is inversely proportional to the square of the error radius   xt  yt  =   1/eei2 *  xi  yi    /  1/eei2  the positioning systems location estimates having a smaller error radius tend to be closer to the tag  therefore  by using 1/ri2  the algorithm is able to give higher weight to sample points that are closer to 13 the tag  the accuracy of this algorithm depends more on the estimated position  xi  yi  as reported by the positioning system and also to a large extent on the distribution of samples around the tagged entity  we assume that with enough samples  this will be averaged out  plain averages  an algorithm that computes the location coordinates of the tagged entity as the statistical average of the readers location when it detected the entity   xt  yt  =   xti  yti   / nt the accuracy of this algorithm is similar to weighted average algorithm  however  since this algorithm does not take into account the error estimate of the positioning system  the errors in the estimated location this algorithm will be slightly higher compared to the estimated error for the weighted average  figure 13  screenshot of our tag tracker gui before convergence  x marks the actual location of the tags   figure 13 shows our tag tracking gui  which shows the computed positions of detected tags  by the three algorithms  on a map of the room  14 5.3 bluebot performance we used a large open 12.5m x 13.75m room  figure 14  to carry out a series of experiments to examine the performance of our prototype system  5.3.1 experiment set a in the first round of experiments  the positioning engine was calibrated for the entire room as described in section 4.2.1 for this setup  as seen in table 2   the positioning systems accuracy was around 4m  the tag placement for this set of experiments is as shown in figure 14 we recorded the performance of the three algorithms for this setup for four different runs of the experiment  figure 15 shows the performance for one such run  figure 14  bluebot

sample distribution w.r.t time for two different experiment runs it is easy to see that the positioning accuracy of the three algorithms greatly varies between tags  part of the reason is due to the large variation in the number of detections for each tag  in our experiments we started the roomba from the center of the experiment area  however  we noticed that since it moved in a random fashion  the number of detection samples for each tag is not a uniform distribution  we expect 16 that the averaging effect  from several runs of the experiment  to smooth out the large variation  figure 16 shows the time distribution between consecutive detections  since the number of samples per tag per run is different  the values  per run  have been normalized to be on the same scale  we define the term error distance as the difference between the estimated location and the actual location of the tagged item  the three positioning algorithms start with a large error distance and as they get more samples  they slowly converge to the actual location of the tag  in order to quantify the performance of our system  we define a convergence point for each tag  in each run of the experiment   convergence point can be thought of as the start of the steady state for a tag  beyond this point  there is no significant change in the computed coordinates for that tag  for example  the convergence values for figure 15 are shown in table 4 we use convergence values to find the accuracy of our system  table 5 shows the average time and the average number of samples at which the algorithms converged for each run of the experiment  table 6 and figure 17 show the mean and median at convergence for each of the three algorithms  as we can see from figure 17  the intersection algorithm was

reason why the intersection and the averaging algorithm didnt converge to same error distance  as an example  we look at figure 18 which shows the performance of the wi-fi positioning system and each of the three algorithms at every sample  for experiment set a tag b  figure 15   the two averaging algorithms depend more on the positioning systems accuracy and hence  their performance is close to positioning systems accuracy  which as we saw in section 4.2.1 was close to 4m   referring to figure 18a  one would expect a uniform distribution of the estimate  from positioning engine  around the actual 15.2m ; however that was not the case  the positioning engine has an offset close to 3.5m in the estimated x  actual x=15.2m  estimated x from positioning engine varies between 11.5m to 13m   for the averages algorithm to converge to the actual location  the offset from the positioning engines needs to be uniformly spread above and below the actual location  in this case  the offset was always below ; hence the large error  the intersection algorithm on the other hand is based on the intersection of several confidence circles  the intersection algorithm gives an area where the tracked entity is located  to better represent the result of the algorithm  the center of the bounding box around the intersection area is reported as the computed location  a close examination of the two graphs shows that the error estimate for the first few samples is high resulting in larger confidence circles  the intersection of these circles gives a large area  the centroid of which is reported as the calculated location  as the experiment proceeds  the error estimate  ee  decreases  later on  more circles  with smaller radius  intersect and the intersection area slowly shrinks the centroid until a point where all the new circles overlap the intersection area or the intersection area is so small that there is not much change in its centroid  this is when the intersection algorithm converges  18 36 4.5 15 35 4 14.5 13 2.5 12.5 12 11.5 plainx a  3 32 2.5 31 30 1.5 29 2 1.5 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 64 sam ple no  ekahau est x 3.5 33 2 1

placed in front of it  this change in the environment altered the signal strength map of the room and hence affected the positioning systems accuracy  as a result  the three algorithms have a relatively higher error distance  this illustrates the inability of the  signal strength-based  positioning systems to adapt to change in environmental conditions  some tracking applications may require recalibration of the room to accommodate the change in the signal strength pattern  6 conclusion and future research in this paper  we have presented an inexpensive automated indoor asset tracking system called bluebot  this prototype system works by making use of any off-the-shelf location positioning system and passive rfid technology  beyond simply providing a novel mechanism to track tagged items  our experiments have shown that our positioning algorithms can bring a three-fold improvement on the raw accuracy provided by the positioning technology  we also found that the intersection algorithm worked better than the two averages algorithm when the positioning system was not very accurate  in the case where the positioning system had high accuracy  the averages algorithm out-performed the intersection algorithm  we are look at new algorithms that can average out the offset in the raw location reported by the positioning system  in our current system  there is a high variation in the amount of time and number of samples required to converge to a certain level of accuracy  in the future  we are planning to reduce this variation by using a robot that can be controlled to move in a directed pattern  we have considered employing a feedback system ; so that the direction of the robot is controlled by the rf system  a dual-variable gain antenna system can be used such that the high gain antenna controls the movement of the robot until its low gain partner sees the tag being hunted  we noticed that signal strength based wi-fi systems are easily affected by changes in the surroundings  in the future we plan to make use of systems that are immune to environmental changes  perhaps tdoa based positioning systems  and analyze the performance of our bluebot system  another approach would be to continue to use wi-fi signal strength  but add reference rfid tags through the environment that could be used to remove any positional offsets that might be present relative to the original calibration  we are also looking at various ways to make 3d positioning possible  7 acknowledgments we thank sastry duri and amaresh rajasekharan at ibm watson for
