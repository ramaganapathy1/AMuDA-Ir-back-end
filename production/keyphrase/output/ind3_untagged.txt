however  another special system for indoor localization is needed in the complicated indoor environment  where the global positioning system  gps  is not available  rfid technology makes the building up of indoor localization system with low cost possible  landmarc is an indoor localization system using rfid technology  which introduces the concept of reference tag to reduce the number of deployed rfid readers and provides high possibility to be used in reality  and we can guarantee the accuracy of localization and thus lower the cost of importing system with it  in this paper  we analyze the existing landmarc system  solve the potential problems within it and propose a more efficient mechanism to enhance the accuracy of indoor localization  1 introduction ubiquitous computing is the major infra technique of the next generation of information technology  which means all things such as human  objects  buildings etc  are equipped with embedded processor and are able to connect with networks to compute and exchange information  ubiquitous computing system is composed of objects which are equipped with embedded processors and connected together through communication modules  and it can be accessed anytime and anywhere and can be easily provided into real world  in other words  ubiquitous computing system is very useful in our daily life  localization application  which is one of the important usages of ubiquitous computing system  is obtaining more and more attentions recently  which makes the development of ubiquitous localization technology and the ubiquitous computing system based on the technology very necessary  there have been many universities and research centers doing researches on automatic localization technology for years  1   and these technologies can be categorized into three main aspects  triangulation  scene analysis and proximity  each of which can be further divided into several detailed technologies  global positioning system  gps   2  is a commonly used localization system nowadays  but for gps is a system depending on satellite  it is hard to localization in the complicated indoor environment  in order to overcome the disadvantage of gps and locate object accurately in the complicated indoor environments  researchers developed several indoor location sensing system  such as  active badge  4   which used diffuse infrared technology to realize indoor location positioning ; radar  3   5   an rf based system for locating and tracking objects inside buildings using a standard ieee 802.11 network adapter ; cricket location support system  6  and active bat  8  location system based on ultrasonic technology ; and spoton  7   9   10   which is a wellknown location sensing systems using the rfid technology  some other technologies  such as composing sensor network or rfid system with sensors which are embedded with reading tags  12   are also being investigated  all these indoor localization systems have their own advantages and limitation as well  among which the location sensing system use commercially available rfid devices can reduce construction cost  landmarc  11  which is developed by michigan state university and hong kong university of science & technology together is a typical example  prototype  of indoor localization system using rfid technology  landmarc introduces the concept of reference tag to reduce the number of deployed rfid readers and guarantee the accuracy of localization at dr myong-soon park is the corresponding author  proceedings of the ieee international conference on sensor networks

 we analyze the existing landmarc system  and propose a mechanism with more efficiency  stability and accuracy to solve the potential problems within landmarc  and our purpose is to enhance the accuracy of indoor localization  2 landmarc system with the purpose of increasing the locating accuracy with less rfid reader  landmarc utilize the concept of reference tag  reference tags are the active tags whose locations are fixed to help location calibration  and they serve as reference points in the system  this approach has three major advantages  first  there is no need for a large number of expensive rfid readers  and use extra  cheaper rfid tags instead  thus can be more practical due to cost constraint  second  the environmental changes can easily be accommodated  the signal strength and detecting range of a same tag can be various in a complicated indoor environment  so it is hard to estimate the distance between reader and tag only by the detected signal strength  but for the reference tags are subject to the same effect in the environment as the tags to be located  this approach helps offset many environmental factors that contribute to the variations in detected range  third  the location information is more accurate and reliable  the main focus of landmarc is to find out the tracking tags nearest neighbour reference tags by comparing the signal strength of tracking tags and reference tags detected by reader  and grant the selected reference tags whose signal strength is close to the tracking tags higher weighting value  and then obtain the object location by computing the weighting value and the reference tags real positions  suppose we have n rfid readers along with m reference tags in an indoor location sensing system  and each rfid reader is configured with continuous mode  which means it reports the tags that are within the specified range continuously  we define the signal & strength vector of a tracking tag as s  s1  s2    sn  and the corresponding signal strength vector for & reference tags as t  t 1  t 2    t n   the euclidian distance in signal strength between a tracking tag and a reference tag r j can be defined as n ej  t i  si  2  j  1  m   the e vector denotes i 1 the location relationship between the reference tags and the tracking tag  and the smaller the e value is  the nearer reference tag is to the tracking tag  and & then  with the e vector e  e1  e 2    e m  of m reference tags  landmarc will choose k reference tags with smallest e values as the neighbour tags  and obtain the tracking tags location by 1 k e i2   x  y  wi  x i  y i   w j k 1 i 1 2 e i 1 i 3 problems with landmarc landmarc approach does show that active rfid is a viable cost-effective candidate for indoor localization  but it still has the following problems  first  all the reference tags are supposed to be candidates when choosing the neighbor tags and this will bring in much unnecessary computation  for to choose the neighbor tags  landmarc will compute all the euclidian distances between the tracking tag and every reference tag using the function n ej  t i  s i  2  j  1  m  and compare different i 1 e values  as shown in figure 1  only reader 2  3 and 4 are able to detect the target tag  so the reference tags which are beyond the detecting range of reader 2  3 and 4 have little chance to be near to the target tag  but if we use the function above directly  the reference tags which are only within the reader 1s detecting range will participate in the computation too  and thus lead to unnecessary computations and increase the servers working load  and this will also contribute to the system latency and affect the reporting of the targets location in time  second  for the target tags location is obtained by the neighboring tags  the accuracy of locating result relies on the placement of reference tags  especially the density of the deployed reference tags  in other word  because we simply compute the location of tracking tag with neighboring reference tags and their weighting values  the error range of the locating result can be constrained in a polygon composed of neighboring reference tags  the lower deployment density of reference tags  the higher error range will be result in  so in order to decrease the result error  we should deploy the reference tags at a high density  and proceedings of the ieee international conference on sensor networks  ubiquitous  and trustworthy computing  sutc06  0-7695-2553-9/06 $ 20.00 2006 ieee as a result  we need more reference tags  but with more tags  the interference among tags will be more serious when reader detecting signals from them  and the accuracy of the detected signal strength between tags and reader will be affected  1 2 target tag

neighboring tags  the coordinate  xic  yic  of each tag in k can be gained through triangulation mechanism  and the average error range of the k neighboring tags can be obtained by  'x  'y   rfid reader 4  t 1 k 1 k ' x  'yi   we can also use i k k i1 i 1 the triangulation mechanism to get the coordinate  xc  y c  of the target tag  as shown in figure 2 then the accurate location of the target can be obtained by adding the computed coordinate result  x c  y c  with the 3 figure 1 four readers are deployed and only three readers can tag the target object  this paper overcomes the above problems of landmarc and proposes a more efficient  effective and accurate mechanism for indoor localization  average error range of the k neighboring tags  5 experiment and result analysis 4 proposed

position just like landmarc  we still use n rfid readers along with m reference tags to construct an indoor location sensing system  and each rfid reader is configured with continuous working mode  supposing we have p rfid readers tracking the target object  and r stands for the collection of reference tags which are simultaneously detected by q  3 d q d p  rfid readers  let r donates the number of reference tags belong to r  and we use r as the collection of candidate tags for neighboring tags and obtain the the experiment environment is illustrated in figure 3.we place 4 rfid readers in a room and 20 active tags as reference tags  and the distance between reference tags is set to 2m uniformly  the number of candidates for neighboring tags is k 4  11   and there are 10 tracking tags on different positions and we conduct the experiment by locating each of them 100 times  the locating result is defined as  x t  c  y t  c   t 1,2   ,10  c 1,2   100   x t  y t   t 1,2   ,10 donate the

this paper analyze the landmarc system  an indoor location sensing system based on rfid technology  and proposed a more efficient  effective and accurate mechanism and solve the problems with landmarc  the proposed mechanism can reduce computing load by reducing the number of candidates for neighboring tags  and thus reduce the latency in locating  when the neighboring tags are selected  while landmarc just simply compute the target coordinate with positions of the neighboring tags and their granted weighting values  the proposed mechanism get the target coordinate by further adding the computed coordinate result with the average error range of all the neighboring tags  and thus can reach higher locating accuracy   5  p bahl  v n padmanabhan  and a balachandran  enhancements to the
