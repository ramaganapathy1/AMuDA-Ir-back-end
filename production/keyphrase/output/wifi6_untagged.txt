marvelous development of wireless techniques and ubiquitous deployment of wireless systems indoors  myriad indoor location-based services  ilbss  have permeated into numerous aspects of modern life  the most fundamental functionality is to pinpoint the location of the target via wireless devices  according to how wireless devices interact with the target  wireless indoor localization schemes roughly fall into two categories  device based and device free  in device-based localization  a wireless device  e.g  a smartphone  is attached to the target and computes its location through cooperation with other deployed wireless devices  in device-free localization  the target carries no wireless devices  while the wireless infrastructure deployed in the environment determines the targets location by analyzing its impact on wireless signals  this article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective  in this survey  we review the recent advances in both modes by elaborating on the underlying wireless modalities  basic localization principles  and data fusion techniques  with special emphasis on

facilities  there is a need for real-time monitoring the location of wandering patients for timely treatment ; in warehouses  staff need assert tracking services that detect the goods and inventory in real time ; in art exhibitions  there is a need for viewers to find out the most interesting paintings in a large museum ; and so forth  obviously  these ilbss have been bounded up with social activities of humans  such that there is a pressing need to accurately and effectively gain the location information  to this end  although outdoor localization has been accurately and successfully completed by gps technique  indoor localization still leaves an open problem  more specifically  gps can not be guaranteed to work well in a complex indoor area due to the blockage of satellite signals  in addition  it requires higher location resolution to pinpoint the position of users in indoor environments than in outdoor  consequently  it brings new challenges for designing indoor localization systems based on the demands of high accuracy  time-critical constraints  and energy efficiency  recent advances in mobile and wireless computing have begun a new era for indoor localization  nowadays  the adoption of smartphones has driven widespread development of a variety of ilbss  for example  facebook nearby to find friends nearby in a fancy party or share current real-world locations  yelp to help customers find nearby recommended restaurants  shopkick to verifies users present physical location so as to earn check-in rewards of nearby retail  and so forth  these ilbss associated with social networking help people coordinate interactions  understand social patterns  and meet new friends  more importantly  they trigger the research community to introduce commodity smartphones for indoor localization  in this article  we comprehensively study the corresponding smartphone-based techniques  which are divided into single-modality and multimodality categories  besides  a review of multiple specific hardware-based technologies  including ultrawideband  uwb   ultrasonic  infrared  rfid  and zigbee  is also presented  however  all these techniques require special hardware  in contrast  due to its increasing application-driven demand and commodity access  smartphone-based indoor localization is growing with increasing interest in recent research and the marketplace  despite that device-based techniques have made considerable progress to improve localization performance  device-free techniques are more favorable when associated with the following important applications  intrusion detection and tracking identify whether anomaly objects exist and locate them in an area of interest  border protection prevents terrorists from entering a forbidden area  safety precaution assists lonely elders or disabled individuals in an emergency like empyrosis  fall  apoplexia  and so forth  in these circumstances  there is an emerging need to seek a cost-effective yet appropriate tool for device-free indoor positioning  first  we need to understand the distinct features of device-free techniques  the key difference from device-based techniques is that no device is attached to the entities in device-free systems  as depicted in figure 1 consequently  it brings in new challenges such as anomaly detection and locating the entity  we then investigate existing device-free localization systems that harness uwb radar  ultrasonic  infrared  camera  rfid  zigbee sensor  and wifi  afterward  we provide performance comparisons in multiple aspects  there are numerous works falling into the category of wireless indoor localization  but in this article  we only focus on some recent advances in this area  we restrict our scope of wireless from the low-frequency fm signals to high-frequency  uwb  signals  and also extend it to visible lights due to the increasing ubiquity and importance of built-in cameras on smartphones  the main contributions are   1  to the best of our knowledge  this is the first survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective  that is  with and without the device attached acm computing

localization systems  to the target  in contrast to most other surveys concentrating on techniques and algorithms   2  we list the different requirements for both categories and the corresponding challenges  as well as provide a comprehensive comparison for each category   3  we also highlight the attraction of using a smartphone for developing device-based indoor location systems because the abundant hardware integrated in it can be leveraged for positioning   4  finally  we discuss the open research issues  the remainder of this survey is structured as follows  section 2 introduces the different application scenarios categorized by device based and device free  section 3 reviews device-based localization for indoor space  in section 4  we introduce research on device-free indoor positioning  section 5 discusses open issues and future directions in this vibrant field  finally  the survey closes in section 6  2 application scenarios ilbss have emerged at incredible speed these years with the tremendous development of wireless technologies  according to different application scenarios  we categorized the existing techniques into two folds  device based and device free  in general  the applications requiring specific devices on the entities to fulfill the localization function belong to the device-based category  otherwise  the ones whose subjects carry no device pertain to the device-free category  to support adaptive and convenient indoor ilbss of variety  understanding the distinct requirements is critical for designing a qualified localization system  figure 2 provides the detailed taxonomy of wireless indoor localization systems from the device perspective  this section introduces the diverse application scenarios together with the corresponding demands ranging from device based to device free  also  the challenges for each category will be discussed  2.1 device based to begin with  a device-based indoor localization system needs to meet the following key demands in varying degrees  accuracy  high accuracy is the primary concern for a wide range of ilbss  for example  navigation and way-finding that help users determine their direction from one place to another to find the destination using mobile devices  another example is assert tracking in which attached tags on products help to identify and locate the missing one  the accurate position information  physical or symbolic  of entities is indispensable in these well-known applications and services  note that acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:4 j xiao et al  fig  2 taxonomy of wireless indoor localization  different ilbss have diverse accuracy needs  for instance  less precision is sufficient for location-based advertisements like restaurant recommendations  as yelp does  and room-level accuracy is enough to find a specific shop in a large mall  real time  to quickley estimate the location of lost or injured people is of the highest priority for a certain time-critical ilbs  emergency response is at one end of the spectrum  and the user is nearly always motivated to disclose location information as accurately and quickly as possible  in this way  ambulance staff can move quickly to approach the victim location to conduct the search-and-rescue work  real-time action is also required in healthcare assistance for preventing medical negligence by locating the patient promptly  cost  to realize an indoor localization system  cost is one of the most important factors for commercial success  four major ingredients exist   1  hardware cost  this includes terminals like tags and smartphones carried by users or objects to be localized   2  infrastructure cost  some localization systems can work with standalone devices  but most systems need the support of extra infrastructure to construct a network  for example  for a wlan-based localization system  the device is required to transmit or receive signals with ap to obtain the measurements for position estimation   3  installation cost  most of the localization systems require installation and configuration before usage  for network-based systems  equipment should be installed  powered  and connected to form a network  and related software may also need to be installed on this equipment for management and data collection  moreover  for fingerprint-based systems  offline calibration is a prerequisite of localization  which is known to be a tedious process   4  maintenance cost  for a positioning system using a large set of devices  such as zigbee sensors  active rfid tags   the long-term maintenance process  e.g  battery replacement  can be complicated and costly  all these costs need to be taken into consideration such that it will not be too exorbitant to develop an indoor positioning system  energy efficiency  alleviating energy concerns is of high importance for the design of localization methods  for vast ilbss  e.g  social networking  advertising  and promotion  enabled by context-aware smartphones  power consumption is a limiting factor  this is because the capacity of the smartphone battery restricts proper functioning of these ilbss  nevertheless  power-limited wireless sensor networks encounter the same problem  the numerous deployed sensor nodes need to be powered with a dry cell for communication so as to fulfill the positioning duty  since replenishment of power resources might be impossible in some circumstances  an energy-efficient strategy will be indispensable for these device-based approaches  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:5 fig  3 challenges for device-based indoor localization  scalability  scalability is a key element for an indoor location system  especially for enterprise usage  the localization system can be overloaded with the increase of user density  which results in inadequate latency in tracking  for some localization systems that involve information exchange between the devices and the server  the devices have to compete with each other for the transmission opportunity due to limited number of wireless channels  the delay will increase as the competition intensifies  in addition  since the transmission range of wireless signals using a specific technique is limited  the wider the area of interest is  the more infrastructure is needed  therefore  the system should be scalable to cope with additional devices and be able to cover a large area of interest without degrading the service  privacy  device-based indoor localization raises many privacy concerns if entities are tracked by their positions or by analyzing their route history  although such history analysis may help many applications to get a perfect customer model  it can disclose the location information of users  and the location information is closely related to a user and reflects the users everyday life  to maintain privacy  the user should be informed prior to collecting their information and be able to decide whether to provide this information to the business communities or to hide their real identifications  in order to meet the aforementioned requirements  several challenges exist  signal reflection  the foremost source that brings difficulty for indoor localization is the multipath effect  the complex indoor areas surrounded by equipment  i.e  furniture  and human beings are the causes of the multipath effect in radio propagation  figure 3a   thus  coordinating the location estimation of an entity is susceptible to the presence of obstacles and humans due to multipath effect  the phenomenon becomes even worse when multiple entities exist between the transmitter and receiver in radio-based techniques  it also serves as the major concern for time of arrival  toa  as a distance metric  signal blocking  most indoor localization techniques also suffer from non-line-ofsight  nlos  propagation  which is known as radio based  these radio-based approaches depend on the line-of-sight  los  radio signal propagation path between the transmitters and receivers  however  the ambient obstacles in indoor venues commonly lead to nlos that constrains the radio transmissions and results in erroneous location estimation  figure 3b   in particular  the performance of the angle-ofarrival  aoa  -based positioning system degrades greatly if the los signal is blocked by obstructions  environment dynamic  the indoor environment is more dynamic than outdoor for localization  human movement is one of the main reasons for the variance of the measurements  opening and closing the door and changing the position of large furniture can also cause significant influence on the performance of indoor localization  especially for fingerprint-based systems  figure 3c   as a result  we need to update the map  the position information of the infrastructure  or the fingerprint database periodically  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:6 j xiao et al  2.2 device free as mentioned previously  device-free indoor positioning systems will take over the role of device-based ones in some important application scenarios like intrusion detection and burglary prevention  this is because device-based mechanisms will no longer be suitable since there arent any trackable devices attached to entities  hereby  we summarize the requirements for the device-free category as follows  accuracy  similar to the device-based localization context  to accurately locate the device-free object is important  it should be noted that here the accuracy includes not only the localization accuracy but also the detection accuracy  unlike devicebased techniques that naturally obtain the status of the subject  the foremost step of device-free ones is to accomplish the detection function  the result of detecting the appearance or movement of an entity will directly influence the localization performance  reliability  in a device-free location system  the prerequisites of localization include detecting the motions and counting the coexisting entities  false alarm and miss detection are two of the most commonly used metrics to evaluate the reliability of the system  which  however  involve tradeoff and compromise  on the one hand  false alarm will introduce unnecessary location computations and also has the potential to divert responders away from legitimate emergencies  on the other hand  miss detection will greatly degrade the localization accuracy and may also lead to property or even life loss due to ignored emergencies  real time  real-time positioning and tracking have been recognized as of great importance for many device-free ilbss  for example  to monitor the status of an alone elder person or to perceive the activity of an immature child at home  timely response will help to prevent certain dangerous situations like falls  cardiopathy  or epilepsy  robustness  for application scenarios like intrusion detection and border protection  the targets are definitely noncooperative  hence  to avoid intentional circumvention of intruders  there should be as few dead spots as possible within the area of interest  moreover  the localization system should be robust enough to provide relatively consistent performance in different conditions like weather  temperature  humidity  light  and so on  the interesting challenges in device-free indoor localization arise mainly as follows  burstiness  since the target is not able or willing to exchange information with the location system  it is impossible to predict the appearance and disappearance of any target  as the trigger of localization  the system needs to continuously monitor the area of interest to detect the abnormal variance  unfortunately  a larger scan interval leads to a higher miss detection ratio  while a shorter scan interval is less energy efficient and also results in a higher false alarm possibility  anonymity  we can easily distinguish different targets in device-based location systems according to the identifications of the devices  unfortunately  in the devicefree scenario  it is difficult to obtain the identification of the entities  even their size or shape  and to discriminate each individual entity  which is essential for tracking  because the measurement results are the combination from multiple entities  figure 4b   mutuality  unlike localizing multiple targets with devices  whose procedures are nearly independent  the localization of one entity may be affected by the coexistence of another if in device-free localization  this mutuality brings in difficulty to properly locate multiple targets simultaneously  take the fingerprint-based system as an example  in a device-based scenario  all users can share the same fingerprints with no acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:7 fig  4 challenges for device-free indoor localization  fig  5 candidate sensing modalities on smartphones for indoor localization  significant error  however  a fingerprint for each possible coexisting case is required to localize multiple device-free entities accurately  figure 4c   3 device-based indoor localization device-based approaches are widely applied for localization to support numerous ilbss  with the proliferation of smartphones that are used for social communication these days  smartphone-based indoor localization has become a popular method for providing a variety of ilbss  smartphones are known to be of easy programmability  large storage capacity  and low price  moreover  there are all kinds of modalities as shown in figure 5  e.g  wifi  cellular  fm radio  bluetooth  microphone  inertial sensors  etc   embedded in smartphones today that can be used separately or integrally for localization purposes  it should reinforce the point that leveraging the smartphones built-in modalities can eliminate the need for additional hardware  in this circumstance  numerous smartphone-based approaches are springing up to address the indoor localization problem  meanwhile  several candidates exist to achieve the same goal that require specific hardware  including infrared  ultrasonic  rfid  and zigbee  and we categorize them as tag based  in this section  we review a large body of proposals and systems in recent years  mainly in two folds  smartphone based and specific tag based  note that  although some works are not evaluated on a smartphone  we still classify them as smartphone based if we can find the corresponding modules on a smartphone that hold the potential to meet the technique requirements  3.1 smartphone based in this subsection  we introduce smartphone-based solutions according to different modalities  including visible lights  wifi  inertial sensors  acoustic  fm  bluetooth  cellular  and the combination of different modalities  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:8 j xiao et al  fig  6 light based  epsilon  li et al  2014a   3.1.1 camera  cameras are one of the most important smartphone sensors and offer to leverage computer vision for indoor localization  with photos as input  visual features are extracted as spatial references  forming a 3d map  werner et al   2011  introduce a camera-based positioning system by combining image recognition with a flexible distance estimation  ops  manweiler et al  2012  enables object localization by constructing a 3d model of the object and mapping it to ground locations  conversely  sextant  tian et al  2014  combines built-in inertial sensors to obtain relative position measurements from visual reference points and computer-vision-based image matching to triangulate user locations  computer-vision-based approaches often achieve high accuracy but are vulnerable to light conditions  require los propagations  and are relatively computational extensive  the increasingly widely used light-emitting diode  led  lights have been proposed for accurate localization  based on the existing lighting infrastructure  any devices with light-sensing capability  e.g  a smartphone  can be located in a highly accurate  low-cost  and easy-to-use fashion  li et al   2014a  use led lamps as anchors  each bulb acts as a landmark and broadcasts location beacons carrying information  such as the position of the bulb  the receiver uses the light sensor to retrieve the beacon information and measures the distances from these beacon lamps based on optical channel models  it then determines its location via triangulation  figure 6   luxapose  kuo et al  2014  further improves visible light positioning  vlp  to support high light density without coordination and to provide orientation with improved localization accuracy  yang et al   2015b  enable vlp on smart glasses  3.1.2 wifi  due to its wide availability and prevalent infrastructure  wifi-based indoor positioning has become an attractive approach of supreme importance  the discovery of the position can be realized utilizing various measurements including toa  aoa  rss  and csi  figure 7 illustrates the settings of wifi-based localization systems  toa is a popular location estimation method commonly applied for ultrasonic-based indoor localization  the feasibility of performing toa on wifi-based networks  i.e  802.11b  has been studied in yamasaki et al   2005  with a positioning accuracy of 2.4m at the 67th percentile with 10 aps and three-branch diversity  giustiniano and mangold  2011  develop the caesar system with commodity hardware using a combination of time-of-flight  tof  and signal-to-noise  snr  measurements  however  the performance of a toa-based system will degrade significantly under nlos conditions  besides  due to the high speed of the rf signal  it requires highly accurate time synchronization  sen et al   2015  proposed cupid2.0  a tof-based localization system achieving a mean localization error of 1.8 meters using commodity wifi devices  it combines the energy of the direct path  edp  and the time-of-flight of the direct path  tfdp  to enable accurate ranging to deal with hardware noises and client diversity for tof-based ranging schemes  tonetrack  xiong et al  2015  combines measurements from multiple channels to derive a high-resolution channel impulse response and toas  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:9 fig  7 an overview of wifi-based indoor localization systems  a wifi-enabled device measures wifi signal features  e.g  toa  aoa  rss  csi  from multiple access points to pinpoint its location  and proposes a spectrum identification scheme to eliminate the impact of nlos paths  the system achieves a median accuracy of 90cm by combining three 20mhz channels  aoa provides another way for indoor localization with submeter accuracy  to determine the objects position  aoa estimates the angle of the arrived signal from the object with measurements of at least two aps  xiong and jamieson  2012  leverage the mimo techniques with multiple antennas in aps to enable fine-grained aoa-based indoor localization  in arraytrack  xiong and jamieson 2013   there are two novel heuristics  intra-ap triangulation for distinguishing los from the nlos path and pseudospectrum matching that eliminates multipath reflections  based on the warp platform  arraytrack achieves a median accuracy of 23cm  however  such aoa-based arraytrack prototypes are far from practice because neither the tailoring hardware  i.e  16 antennas for each ap with complicated arrangements  nor nontrivial collaborative measurements by multiple aps are available  spotfi  kotaru et al  2015  adopts superresolution aoa estimation algorithms and proposes a set of filtering and estimation techniques to derive the los aoa using commercial wifi infrastructure  the system achieves a median accuracy of 40cm and is robust to multipath propagation  received signal strength  rss  is the most commonly used signal feature for wifibased indoor localization  bahl and padmanabhan 2000 ; youssef and agrawala 2005 ; chintalapudi et al  2010 ; park et al  2010 ; goswami et al  2011   theocratically  rss decreases monotonically with distance in free space  rappaport 2002   so that the distance of the target can be calculated from rss  unfortunately  in indoor spaces with severe multipath effects  the propagation model can fail and these rss-based distance measurements can be inaccurate  in this manner  an rss-based fingerprinting approach is proposed  it consists of two phases   1  offline training phase rss fingerprint  radio map  generation  site survey  and  2  online positioning phase localization by matching the test point to a radio map  although rss-based fingerprinting has shown to be comparatively accurate  it is still far from practical for the following reasons  it is labor intensive and time consuming to construct an rss-based radio map  it is difficult to maintain and update this fingerprint database for a specific indoor area since the environmental dynamics are inevitable  many researchers endeavor to reduce the overhead of fingerprinting  chintalapudi et al   2010  ease the calibration task via a genetic algorithm that models the physical constraints  the key finding is that wifi-enabled devices like smartphones can obtain the location fix of the edge of the indoor area  which provides the environment characteristics  park et al   2010  design an organic indoor location  oil  system to release the radio map construction efforts  the initial oil fingerprints database is empty and developed by user-provided information  to improve convergence rates  a voronoi-based acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:10 j xiao et al  table i csi versus rss metric csi rss measurement band base band rf band layering phy mac granularity fine grained  per symbol  coarse  per packet  temporal stability high low frequency diversity yes no user promoting algorithm is applied in oil  goswami et al   2011  bypass the laborious fingerprint construction phase by proposing an unsupervised learning-based wigem system  wigem can adapt to real time changes in environments by learning the parameters from the gaussian mixture model  gmm   therefore  the predeployment burden of rss-based fingerprinting can be relieved  on the other hand  fingerprinting-based localization schemes may perform better at some locations than others  it is simply difficult to expect consistent localization performances using an evenly sampled fingerprint database  some researchers proposed an algorithm to optimally approximate the actual fingerprint database using both model-based virtual fingerprints and actual fingerprints  li et al  2014b   therefore  scenario-catered calibration  e.g  fingerprint database building  seems indispensable if the localization system were to be deployed at scale  recently  an alternative to rss has been suggested for indoor localization using the ubiquitous wlan infrastructure  known as channel state information  csi   wu et al  2012a  2013   csi is used today  e.g  in ieee 802.11a/g/n  wimax  and lte  and is available on commercial products  it represents the channel conditions over individual n ofdm subcarriers across the physical  phy  layer  specifically  csi  h =  hi  i=1  represents the wireless channel at the granularity of subcarriers  for each subcarrier i  hi represents its complex channel gain  hi = |hi |e jarg  hi    1  where |hi | and arg  hi  denote its amplitude and phase  respectively  instead of only one rss per packet  csi values over multiple subcarriers can be obtained at one time  the main differences between csi and rss are displayed in table i  which reveals the superiority of csi compared to rss  the superiority of csi was first proved in halperin et al   2010   and halperin et al  apply csi for throughput improvement by adaptively adjusting the transmission rate  inspired by this work  fila  wu et al  2012a  initiates the use of csi for locating the target in complicated indoor environments by extracting the los path for ranging  as such  fila is the first attempt at leveraging csi for modeling-based indoor localization  even with a simple trilateration calculation for location coordinates  fila can achieve good performance  in xiao et al   2012a   a fine-grained csi-based fingerprinting scheme is proposed for indoor localization  it explores frequency diversity of csi to uniquely identify a location based on the fact that csis over multiple subcarriers have different amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths  after building up the radio map  fifs applies a coherence bandwidth-enhanced probability algorithm for matching the target object to the radio map  likewise  sen et al   2012  develop a spot indoor fingerprinting system  pinloc  using csi and achieve an accuracy of 89 % for 100 spots  3.1.3 inertial sensors  with rapid technological developments  contemporary commercial smartphones offer up a whole slew of embedded sensors  including accelerometers  gyroscopes  proximity sensors  and ambient light sensors  here  we will introduce the indoor positioning solutions that rely on these low-power-consumption  low-cost smartphone-based sensors only  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25

users location by gps  then  the walking patterns  speed  and orientation of this user will be recorded with the accelerometer and compass accordingly  by mapping the walking patterns of user to the local map  the location of the smartphone user can be approximately estimated without war-driving efforts  the indoornav  li et al  2012  system collects sensor data as input for step detector and heading estimator modules by using an accelerometer  compass  and gyroscope  in common sense  each individual may have different body shapes like height and weight that influence the step length estimation  indoornav proposes a reliable step model for step detection and a personalization algorithm to adapt users stride length  by combining these modules with an indoor floor map  indoornav can achieve meter-level accuracy without infrastructure  that is  a mean accuracy of 1.5m in a testbed of 31m5m  figure 8 provides the work flow of indoor nav  we refer interested readers to harle  2013  for a comprehensive survey on inertial-based indoor localization using the dead-reckoning principle  3.1.4 acoustic  the acoustic ranging technique is newly adopted for indoor positioning  with the innate speaker and microphone in a commodity mobile phone  highaccuracy acoustic ranging becomes achievable  here we will review the research on acoustic-based indoor localization  beepbeep  peng et al  2007  is a pioneer acoustic ranging system with high accuracy  in beepbeep  one smartphone a and its peer device b will perform two-way sensing  both devices will in turn send a beep signal and record successive second-scale sound signals from the microphone  then  each device will count the elapsed time between two toa events  noted that this sensing scheme can be extended to multiple devices  in this way  the differential of elapsed times can be computed to realize tdoa for localization  figure 9   the whistle  xu et al  2011  system introduces a synchronization-free toda framework for estimating the location of an object  which is a big breakthrough for the previous tdoa-based approaches  in whistle  two-signal  source signal and successive signal  sensing is done in the first recording step  the second step comes to sample the counting operation  which is done by the receiver  in the third step  ap will finish tdoa calculation by receiving the counting results

et al  2012   fig  11 gsm  skyloc  varshavsky et al  2007   3.1.5 fm  fm radio  88108mhz  has been long integrated on smartphones for entertainment like listening to music or news  the features of fm radio signals are investigated in popleteev et al   2012   the advantages of fm for indoor localization are as follows   1  fm radio consumes less energy than wifi  which is energy efficient for positioning on a smartphone  as shown in figure 10 ;  2  fm signals can penetrate walls more easily than wifi or gsm ; and  3  fm radio is more robust to short-wavelength obstacles than wifi and gsm due to the long wavelength  matic et al   2010  first propose the feasibility of using fm radio for smartphone-based indoor localization  in their system  they introduce the spontaneous recalibration concept to automatically update the fingerprint database  besides  wifi is synergetically integrated with fm radio to enhance the performance of the positioning system  an fm-based indoor fingerprinting system  moghtadaiee et al  2011  is also devised to bypass the timing problem of fm signals and serious multipath effects  in moghtadaiee et al   2011   rss values of fm radio are measured by usrp2  universal software radio peripheral 2  and locations are decided by deterministic nearestneighbor  nn  knn  kwnn  algorithms  the results show that applying the kwnn algorithm will lead to a minimum mean distance error of 2.96m in an 11m 23m indoor area  recently  chen et al   2012  proposed adding physical layer information to fm rss for generating richer location fingerprints  and the accuracy can be improved by 5 %  the experimental results suggest that fm signals are more robust to temporal variations compared to wifi signals  specially  human presence  multipath  and fading have less influence on fm signals  moreover  combining these two signals as a location fingerprint can improve the localization accuracy  the main disadvantage  however  is that fm radios are less popular than wifi in indoor environments  smartphone users tend to turn on wifi or cellular to get online wherever possible  while fewer users would turn on an fm radio broadcast  this makes fm-based solutions complementary and less mainstream  3.1.6 bluetooth  bluetooth  ieee 802.15.1   pervasively available on a smartphone  is designated for short-range  i.e  10m  wireless communication in the 2.4ghz range  it can also be an attractive modality for locating and tracking people and assets indoors  dietrich et al   2004  deploy a moving bluetooth-enabled mobile device as the transmitter  along with a dedicated correlation ic and microcontroller as two receivers  the position is calculated by tdoa measurement to achieve meter-level accuracy  chen et al   2010  present an inquiry-based locating approach using bluetooth rss measurements  there also exist several commercial bluetooth-based indoor positioning systems  such as zonith  teldio 2006   which is used to assist people who work in hazardous environments  the bluetooth chipsets exist in many products like acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:13 mobile phones  tablets  and portable computers with low cost  however  a short-range feature makes it suffer from dense deployment for ubiquitous positioning  this results in relatively high capital investment for infrastructure support  3.1.7 cellular  cellular networks are ideal for ubiquitous and seamless indoor and outdoor localization  and are complementary to wifi-based solutions  various generations of cellular signals have been explored  including global system for mobile  gsm   code division multiple access  cdma   and long-term evolution  lte   otsason et al   2005  propose the first accurate gsm-based indoor fingerprinting system achieving a within-floor median accuracy in 2.48m to 5.44m  figure 11 shows the interfaces of skyloc  a gsm-based indoor localization system  aside from gsm  cdma proves to be a reliable cellular positioning modality  ur rehman et al  2008   unlike gsm-based approaches that rely on rss  cdma leverages signal delay as location fingerprints  which stays robust in frequent cell resizing  the experiments exhibit high accuracy  i.e  4.5m and 6.7m  in two indoor scenarios  to improve the localization capability of cellular networks  the current lte standard  3gpp 2010  has already specified a localization scheme based on the observed time difference of arrival  otdoa   medbo et al   2009  evaluated the performance of lte otdoa-based positioning in urban scenarios using channel sounders  in del peral-rosado et al   2014a   researchers present a joint time-delay and channel estimator to assess the achievable localization performance of lte signals in the presence of multipath  two software-defined radio  sdr  -based lte positioning receivers are implemented in del peral-rosado et al   2014b  to assess the localization performance in commercial lte deployment  experimental results show the potential of accurate indoor localization using commercial lte networks  the synchronization problem when adopting lte otdoa is also addressed in del peral-rosado et al   2015  using time-delay and frequency-tracking loops and a priori known receiver position  with the development of small cell and femtocell  which are specially designed for home or small business regions  the cellular system will cover a wide range of indoor environments and become a competitive indoor localization tool in the coming years  3.1.8 hybrid  hybrid schemes have been developed by compromising the merits of various modalities on smartphones to ponder the indoor localization problem  the aim of these multimodality proposals is to enhance the overall positioning performance  here  we mainly introduce two mainstreams   1  the integration of wifi and inertial sensors and  2  the integration of wifi and acoustic  wifi + inertial sensors  recently  the idea of combining wifi and inertial sensors on a smartphone for positioning has received considerable attention  based on different purposes  the incorporation can be collapsed into two categories  to ease the calibration efforts  zee  rai et al  2012  is a zero-effort indoor localization system via crowdsourcing  with the assistance of a floor plan  zee can obtain site-specific information like the pathways and barriers  without any user participation  zee utilizes crowdsourced sensor data  accelerometer  compass  and gyroscope  to automatically infer locations  these sensor data are combined with wifi and processed by an augmented particle filter  unloc  wang et al  2012  is another hybrid indoor positioning system that eases the burden of site survey  the key observation is that some locations can be identified as landmarks using inertial data  such as elevator and corridor corner  to extract these landmarks  unloc employs unsupervised learning to enable dead-reckoning  unloc can automatically update the landmarks by increasing users without a floor plan  will  wu et al  2012b  proposed a logical map to bypass site survey  in the training phase  the floor plan is constructed logically instead of physically leveraging user trace  this logical map can reveal the relative location relationship between virtual rooms and then be associated acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:14 j xiao et al  with physical rooms  in the serving phase  the user query  wifi readings and accelerometer data  will be sent to the will server  and the server will give back the location information and update the database using newly added data  lifs  yang et al  2012  further reduces the manual cost of site survey by exploring the connection of user motions and previous rss fingerprints  it reforms a highdimensional logical floor plan and maps it to real locations by spatial similarity  in a 1600m2 academic building  lifs achieves an average location accuracy of 5.8m  to increase the positioning accuracy by data fusion  azizyan et al   2009  develop an ambient fingerprinting surroundsense system by combining the wifi information and sensing modalities  light  sound  color  and accelerometer   in surroundsense  these five-part fingerprints compose an ambience fingerprint to be accumulated into a fingerprinting factory  by matching the test fingerprint to candidate ones in this factory  the target logical location can be finally obtained  in kemppi et al   2010   a hybrid angle-based indoor positioning system is associated with pedestrian dead reckoning  pdr  and particle filter  particularly  using a fusion filter  pdr movements and angle-based location estimates are combined with a building vector map  evaluation of the system in different indoor environments shows that seamless positioning coverage and acceptable accuracy can be achieved  kim et al   2012  observe that the location with maximum rss is preserved regardless of the severe rss variance  thus  they develop a smartphone-based pedestrian tracking system by using peak-based wifi fingerprinting  pwf   in addition  digital compass and accelerometer are combined with pwf for improving the accuracy  wifi + acoustic  tarzia et al   2011  present the idea of using an acoustic background spectrum for room-level indoor localization  they design an abs system that first records the background sounds using commercial smartphones  after that  abs extracts the noise-robust fingerprints by filtering out the transient noise and storing it in a database  finally  it guesses the current unlabeled location by finding the closest fingerprint in this database  the abs system is implemented as a free application called batphone on iphones  users can use batphone to distinguish a pair of adjacent rooms with 92 % accuracy  however  the noise rejection problem remains unsolved  it can not cope with the noise introduced by tens of speaking occupants  the chatter state   liu et al   2012  develop a wifi-enabled smartphone indoor localization system  the key observation is that there are abundant peer phones in public indoor places  which bring in physical peer constraints  they thus apply the acoustic ranging technique to reduce the wifi similar signature error  finally  peer-assisted localization can be achieved by jointly using a wifi signature map and acoustic ranging  the prototype results show that it can reduce the maximum and 80 % errors to as small as 2m and 1m  argus  xu et al  2015  proposed another assistant-based wifi localization framework leveraging geometric constraints extracted from photos  other systems target fast response time or energy efficiency  for instance  clips  noh et al  2013  considers that the region is infrastructure free but each user has a received signal strength map for the area in reference by ray-tracing  specifically  clips incorporates wifi beacon messages with dead reckoning to drastically reduce the convergence time  enloc  constandache et al  2009  proposes an energy-efficient positioning system by integrating gps  gsm  and wifi  they quantify the tradeoff between energy and accuracy that underlies a range of emerging services  and characterize the optimal localization accuracy for a given energy budget  gao et al   2013  exploit cross-technology interference signatures for indoor positioning  they design a zifind system that records wifi interference signals by low-power zigbee devices  by applying digital signal processing techniques  unique fingerprints can be extracted from these interference signatures  compared to previous wifi-based fingerprinting systems  zifind is more energy efficient  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective fig  12 uwb  25:15 fig  13 ultrasonic  itagaki et al  2012   3.2 tag based in the previous section  we delineated various localization modalities embedded on smartphones  this subsection presents means of localization using uwb  ultrasonic  infrared  rfid  and wireless sensors  all these approaches require specific hardware to fulfill the positioning functionality and are summarized as tag based  3.2.1 uwb  uwb is a radio technology originally used for wireless communication and later applied for in-building 2d or 3d localization systems  li et al  2007  2009   uwb has been issued as the radio wave whose fractional bandwidth is greater than 20 % or at least 500mhz based on the federal communication commission  fcc  in 2002 this ultrashort  i.e  nanoseconds  impulse uwb with very large bandwidth can suppress rich multipath effects and also result in a high time resolution  which greatly improves positioning accuracy  in addition  uwb signals can penetrate through obstacles easily with low power consumption  these favorable characteristics of uwb account for high positioning accuracy in centimeter scale  figure 12 depicts the common setting for uwb-based localization system  in general  toa or tdoa measurement of the uwb signal is applied to obtain the location of the target  fischer et al  2010 ; zhang et al  2006   while nlos is a challenge for uwb indoor positioning  a novel probabilistic tdoa model is proposed to accommodate this nlos in prorok et al   2011   in a nutshell  for positioning systems employing uwb devices  time-based schemes provide very good accuracy due to the high time resolution  large bandwidth  of uwb signals  moreover  they are less costly than the aoa-based schemes  the latter of which are less effective for typical uwb signals experiencing strong scattering  with the new ieee 802.15.4a standards  the cost of uwb chips is now reduced to around only $ 20 usd  decawave 2015   making uwb competitive with wifi-based indoor localization  the increasing popularity of indoor robots and quadrotors has also attracted renewed interest in employing uwb for highly accurate ranging and localization  kempke et al  2015   however  metallic and liquid materials are sources of interference to the uwb signal and the short communication range  less than 10m  limits its applications except in exceptionally dense networks  3.2.2 ultrasonic  ultrasonic  fischer et al  2008  is a well-known ideal candidate for indoor positioning that relies on the toa scheme  the key idea is to use an ultrasonic transceiver to emit and detect ultrasonic signals  while recording the signal traveling time between a pair of transmitter and receiver  it is possible to compute their separating distance given the medium traveling speed  in general  ultrasonic wave emission is usually directional  which introduces difficulties in orienting the transceiver precisely  the early cricket system  priyantha et al  2000  utilizes the difference in propagation acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:16 j xiao et al  speeds and estimates the distance via coupled rf and ultrasonic signals  although cricket exhibits high accuracy  i.e  6cm  as well as privacy protection  it suffers from the inherent narrowband disadvantage  instead  hazas and hopper  2006  explore the usage of broadband ultrasonic that has superior characteristics over the narrowband counterpart  such a broadband ultrasonic system is deployed using dolphin units and the ranging performance is 2cm  itagaki et al   2012  develop a moving object tracking method based on spread spectrum ultrasonic  figure 13   to handle the doppler effect brought by moving targets  a tracking method by limiting correlation calculation in a defined range is proposed  fercu et al   2009  present an ultrasonic-based living assistance system for people  i.e  elders or handicapped  who may accidentally fall in residences  unfortunately  the presence of obstacles in the surrounding area may block the ultrasonic wave due to its coverage limitations  leading to a decrease in the wave traveling time measurement accuracy  along with high power consumption  3.2.3 rfid  radio-frequency identification  rfid  -based positioning has become more and more popular  for example  in hospitals for locating patients  cangialosi et al  2007   landmarc  ni et al  2004  is the first attempt to apply active rfid tags for localization  it uses reference tags with known locations to adapt to environmental dynamics to enhance the accuracy of location estimation  seco et al   2010  present the usage of gaussian processes to model the rss distribution of rfid tags  in seco et al   2010   71 tags are distributed in an area of 1600m2 to achieve median accuracy of 1.5m  wang et al   2007  propose an rfid-based 3d positioning approach to locate the mobile user equipped with an rfid reader or tag  it applies the rss proximity and optimization to enhance the performance  i.e  0.33 f t   another interesting application based on rfid is to localize and track the demanded library books  choi et al   2006  introduce an rfid-based library information management  r-lim  system to determine the location of a book in search  r-lim system records the ids  i.e  books and shelves  associated with location using rfid tags into a database  thus  the tagged book position can be effectively retrieved by the rfid reader  phase-based rfid ranging allows coherent signal processing and achieves better performance than rss-based schemes  zhang et al  2010   however  simple phase measurements have to deal with phase wrapping  it is thus necessary to perform multiple measurements and use phase difference  povalac and sebesta 2011   nikitin et al   2010  proposed three-phase difference-based positioning techniques in the time  frequency  and spatial domains with modeling and simulations  hekimian-williams et al   2010  adopted a maximum likelihood method for accurate phase differencebased localization and prototyped an sdr-based positioning system  backpos  liu et al  2014  proposed a phase-based hyperbolic positioning technique and achieved a mean accuracy of 12.8cm  mimo techniques further pushed rfid-based localization to centimeter-level accuracy using synthetic aperture radar  sar   wang and katabi 2013   inverse synthetic aperture radar  isar   scherhaufl et al  2014   and hologram  yang et al  2014   3.2.4 sensors  low-cost  low-power-consumption  multifunctional sensor nodes  which consist of sensing  data processing  and communicating components  are widely used tools for localization in wireless sensor networks  wsns   in kusy et al   2007  and chang et al   2008   the doppler shift effect is leveraged to estimate the direction of moving sensors  when a transmit sensor is moving toward a stationary received one  the relative velocity between them determines the doppler shift in the frequency domain  by using the knowledge of the transmitted frequency and the received frequency at the known position  the translational velocity of mobile nodes can be calculated to estimate the location  however  the limitation of the scheme is that it can only locate moving objects  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor

geo-magnetism navigation system  such a system can achieve high accuracy of 90 % within 1.64m  pirkl and lukowicz  2012  employ resonant magnetic coupling for designing a 3d indoor positioning system  in this oscillating magnetic field system  the accuracy resolution is within 1m2  3.3 performance comparison in summary  while the aforementioned technologies share some common traits  there exist certain differences with respect to technological aspects such as accuracy  as well as implementation details  cost  scalability  and energy consumption   the corresponding judging criteria are first given in table ii  divided into seven levels  as shown in figure 14  the star chart consists of four directional axes representing the fourcategory criteria  and for each criterion  there are seven different circular layers  i.e  corresponding to table ii level 16   the innermost layer gives the lowest value of 0 and the outermost layer gives the highest value of 6 the higher the value is  the better performance can be achieved  thereby  a larger area indicates the overall performance is better  accuracy is the key factor to describe how close the estimation from a positioning technique is to match the actual position of users/devices  it is usually determined by the mean distance error  the positioning systems have been developed over a few decades and improved a lot  the measuring units of the positioning accuracy changed from kilometers to meters  the most recent and finest positioning systems can even have few centimeters of error  for this reason  the worst positioning accuracy is set to larger than 100m and the best is set to smaller than 20cm  cost efficiency is evaluated under four mentioned expending costs like hardware  infrastructure  installation  and maintenance costs  the figures can vary from less than us $ 1k to greater than us $ 300k  scalability determines how large of a positioning system can be scaled up  we analyze the possible coverage area of different positioning techniques  due to the limitation of signals or infrastructure  the measuring units could be largely deviated from less than acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:18 j xiao et al  10m2 to larger than 0.1km2  for instance  if a positioning technique makes use of a bluetooth signal  it can be only practical under a few square meters  energy efficiency is measured by how much energy of a positioning technique is spent in an hour in watts  w   we estimate each positioning technique depending on the usual operating power usage of its hardware  a green positioning system may have less than 5w power  for instance  usages of low-power inertial sensors  this criterion can vary from less than 1mw to larger than 100w  for those infrastructure-based indoor localization approaches  infrastructure is the main concern when evaluating cost  while device is the concern when evaluating energy  because only the devices are battery limited  take gsm for example  the power for the base station is 20w  which is much higher than that of the smartphone backend  that is  2w  unlike the gsm-based location system that can make use of an existing base station  the fm-based system needs extra radio towers  which requires an additional licensing fee for spectrum access  note that for those modalities that work in the ism band such as wifi  sensor  and rfid  this expense is exempted  due to the highly controlled and ad hoc evaluations of indoor localization systems  microsoft launched the microsoft indoor localization competition  microsoft 2014  to provide a relatively unified and practical venue for researchers from both academia and industry to compare different indoor localization solutions  in lymberopoulos et al   2015   the organizers summarized the main evaluation results during the 2014 microsoft indoor localization competition with 22 different solutions  they concluded that while 1.6m accuracy is achievable with merely commercial wifi access points  the indoor localization problem is still not solved  the main hurdle is the deployment cost  out of the 22 solutions  the average setting and calibration time is 5 hours for two rooms covering 300 square meters  this may be unrealistic and intrusive when deploying these localization systems in large deployment sites like shopping malls  4 device-free indoor localization device-based indoor localization systems are capable of providing location information of the target who wears a specific smartphone-based or tag-based device  however  this basic requirement does not hold in myriad scenarios  the potential applications are many  in residence communities  emergency situations of elder people  i.e  falls  stuns  can be timely detected for safety precautions ; in hospitals  doctors can monitor the status of patients to rescue them whenever they are in a paroxysm of disease ; in large warehouses and stores  security action is needed for surveillance of an anomalous intrusion  toward this end  device-free indoor positioning is certainly a better fit for the previous ilbs that can mitigate the necessity of carrying it on devices  it serves as an indispensable complement in the context of wireless indoor localization  4.1 existing systems in a similar fashion to section 3  we will introduce the state-of-the-art device-free systems categorized by the frequency in the following  4.1.1 camera  cameras are common for device-free motion detection or localization in a specific site  shieh and huang  2009  describe a video-surveillance system by leveraging multiple cameras for time-efficient elder fall detection  the idea is to identify accidental fall events with a human-shape retrieving algorithm and pattern recognition approach  to reduce the complexity of multi-video-stream processing  pipeline and multithreading methods are introduced  experiments with four web cameras show that the false detection rate is as low as 1 % to 3 %  in the easyliving project  krumm et al   2000  designed a visual person-tracking system using images from two sets of color triclops stereo cameras in a typical living room environment  a stereo module records the images  which works along a person tracker program to produce the result acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a

et al   2007  implement a real-time indoor surveillance and tracking system with 18axis210 network cameras in an office building  a sensor camera sencam  xu et al  2012  system was presented recently for reducing privacy concerns over solely camera-based device-free indoor positioning  besides  camera-assisted recalibration in sencam helps to lessen the time-consuming rss measurements  figure 15 shows the deployment of sencam  4.1.2 infrared  passive infrared  pir  techniques are widely adopted for device-free indoor motion detection and localization  the basis relies on detecting changes of the infrared spectrum in the monitoring region caused by human movements  specifically  theres an obvious distinction between body temperature of a person and ambient temperature  such a difference makes it possible to develop a device-free infrared-based positioning system based on the thermal radiation caused by people  figure 16 shows a representative setting of infrared based dfp localization system  several systems  hauschildt and kirchhof 2010 ; kemper and hauschildt 2010  are proposed to localize entities  in hauschildt and kirchhof  2010   thermal radiation is measured by thermopile arrays to determine the position of the object using the aoa scheme  experiments in a 4.9m to 5.2m area show that the system can achieve centimeter accuracy  kemper and hauschildt  2010  suggest a probability hypothesis density filter to resolve the problems for multitarget counting and data association  even in noisy situations  the mean position error of system is less than 30cm for discriminating and localizing three people  the optex company  optex passive infrared sensor  provides a large amount of pir products for detecting anomaly events  however  pir sensors are limited to los vision and thus the cost of covering a large area will be prohibitive  moreover  the additional radiation from the dynamic environment also brings in challenges for pir technology  4.1.3 uwb radar  uwb radar serves as a means for device-free lbas such as indoor through-wall detection and surveillance  figure 17   yang and fathy  2005  propose a uwb radar system operating at 10ghz  the system composes of a uwb double-ridge horn antenna as the transmitter and a 16-element vivaldi antenna as the receiver  since the short-pulse uwb has strong penetration ability and high power efficiency  through-wall image reconstruction can be performed with high resolution  however  the high sampling rate is challenging for the system of yang and fathy  2005  and also is a crucial requirement for data acquisition  yang and fathy  2009  further developed a real-time see-through wall system with customized fpga firmware  this firmware successfully deals with the challenging uwb signal acquisition problem that maintains high equivalent-time sampling resolution  i.e  100msamples/s   in addition  the system enables motion tracking by integrating a set of analog-to-digital converters

further reduce the complexity of large-scale antennas  a three-dimensional imaging algorithm is presented by sakamoto et al   2011  to estimate the moving target with five antennas  in their work  a spheroidal model is constructed to approximate the shape of a target to determine the translational motion  lei and ouyang alternatively apply the finite-difference timedomain  fdtd  method to design a uwb-based surveillance system  lei and ouyang 2007   the position of the target can be determined by measuring the round-trip time of a uwb wave including the time traveling through the concrete wall  4.1.4 ultrasonic  ultrasonic is well suited for supporting device-free ilbss like pilferage prevention and fall detection inside residences for security and safety purposes  figure 18   one typical example is indoor human presence detection  caicedo and pandharipande 2012   in caicedo and pandharipande  2012   consecutive ultrasonic signals are periodically transmitted and the echoes caused by user movement will be recorded by the receiver  thus  the occurrence of human movement can be monitored by a tracking algorithm with high detection probability  another example is the doorjamb  hnat et al  2012  system  which aims at room-level tracking in dwelling places  ultrasonic range finders are used in each doorway to estimate the users height and direction  as well as to record the passing sequence  doorjamb achieves an average tracking accuracy of 90 %  however  to deploy ultrasonic in large indoor surroundings will be very expensive  4.1.5 wifi  although the previous approaches have contributed to device-free indoor localization  they may not work well in terms of scalability due to either high specialized infrastructure cost like video cameras and rfid tags or maintainable costs  i.e  sensors   wifi-based approaches  youssef et al  2007   on the other hand  leverage the available infrastructure for device-free indoor localization  to enable device-free indoor localization  a process of determining abnormal events anomaly detection or motion detectionis a prerequisite  youssef et al   2007  discuss the challenges that lie in designing a reliable device-free passive  dfp  localization system  in addition  two feature extraction algorithms are proposed for motion detection  namely  moving average  ma  and moving variance  mv   these two algorithms exhibit very high detection performance  i.e  100 % recall and precision  but are constrained in a controlled environment  moussa and youssef  2009  instead apply the maximum likelihood estimator algorithm to enhance the performance of the dfp system in real environments  recently  the rss-based rasid system  kosba et al  2012  further improved the detection accuracy by analyzing the rss features and adopting a nonparametric technique for adapting to environment changes  in xiao et al   2012b   the fine-grained metric csi from the phy layer is introduced for motion detection  which proved to be sensitive to environment changes and resistant to temporal variance  other csi-based human detection schemes harness multipath propagation to acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2

 2015  further proposed a unified framework to detect both moving and static humans via breath detection  in all  these works mainly focus on detecting or predicting the movements of entities in a given area of interest  after the anomaly event of an entity is detected comes the critical yet more challenging part  to ascertain the corresponding position of entities  recently  seifeldin et al   2013  developed a wifi rss-based nuzzer system in a large-scale indoor space  in xiao et al   2013   a fine-grained csi-based device-free indoor localization system  pilot  is proposed  figure 19a   csi can be resistant to temporal variance and sensitive to environment changes by exploiting the frequency diversity  in other words  csi can detect anomalies caused by environmental changes in the area of interest  another beneficial characteristic of csifrequency diversitycan reflect the varying multipath reflections due to entities existence  thus  pilot processes csi to generate passive fingerprints for single-entity localization  note that pilot is the first work to apply csi from the phy layer to improve localization performance  in wi-vi  adib and katabi 2013   wifi enables us to see moving objects through walls and behind closed doors  by using mimo interference nulling  the reflection from static objects is eliminated  and moving targets can be detected  using inverse synthetic aperture radar  isar   wi-vi can track multiple moving objects simultaneously and identify their directions with high probability  figure 19b   4.1.6 wireless sensors  zhang et al   2007  the synonym transceiver-free in wsns  a pioneer zigbee-based transceiver-free tracking system is built up in zhang et al   2007   relying on detecting the small-scale fading caused by human movement  three algorithms are applied to track the moving entities  including midpoint  intersection  and best-cover algorithms  evaluations in a 9m12m empty room indicate that the best-cover algorithm has the best tracking performance  i.e  average error 0.99m  in a 44 grid setting using micaz2 sensors  this work is subsequently improved by a distributed dynamic clustering approach  zhang and ni 2009  that ensures high accuracy even in multiple-target scenarios  other than signal dynamics  the distance between sensor nodes along with the transmission power are taken account in zhang and ni  2009   meanwhile  the proposed probabilistic cover algorithm can reduce the tracking latency to about 2seconds  yang et al   2010  develop a grid-based clustering over k-neighborhood  greek  algorithm to diagnose the presence of intrusion  integrated with a multiple transmitter-receiver pair collaboration strategy  passive intrusion can be accurately detected  later  zhang et al   2011  make further improvement by designing a real-time rass system  figure 20   based on a support vector regression model  rass enables comparative performance  i.e  tracking accuracy 4m  using a much smaller set of sensor nodes  i.e  10 telosb nodes in two adjacent hexagon cells   in wilson and patwari  2010   a radio tomographic imaging  rti  technique is presented for imaging the passive moving entities by

the rfid technique is widely used in large shopping malls or warehouses for preventing pilferage  kuksa et al   2010  propose a device-free geometric system for estimating the location of human beings who move around a monitoring area  in their work  a lines-intersecting-tiles strategy is used for detecting the motion event between a set of rfid-based transmitted readers and received tags  specifically  with a low-density deployment  one for every 500 f t   this system demonstrates mobility acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:22 fig  20

replace the active rfids with passive ones and a few active rfid reader antennas  and propose a tomographic imaging algorithm that provides both low computational complexity and highly accurate position estimates  the benefits of using passive rfids are twofold  they are not only low cost but also easily deployed  although they can achieve 30cm mean accuracy  the authors place 36 transponders in a square with the length of 2.7m in their experiment  and thus the scalability is much lower compared with that of using active rfids  tadar  yang et al  2015a  enables device-free object tracking by deploying a group of rfid tags behind walls as an antenna array and tracking the reflections of objects using a hidden markov model  the system achieves a median tracking error of below 20cm  4.1.8 fm  recently  fm radio  shi et al  2012a  2012b  has proved to be an adequate counterpart for a device-free application  specified as situation awareness  shi et al   2012b  introduce the noncooperative fm radio for distinguishing various activities in ambient environments  including empty room  opened door  people standing  and people walking  figure 21   they implement the prototype using a usrp3 device working at 82.5mhz to extract the fm features  consisting of average amplitude  average magnitude squared  ams   and root of amplitude mean squared  rams   the subsequent classification task is fulfilled by three well-known algorithms  which results in accuracy as high as 90 %  however  those activities are conducted only in a small restricted 12m rectangle  which inflicts hardly predictable near-field effects at the receivers antenna  thus making the system less practical  4.2 performance comparison in this section  a comparison summary of the aforementioned device-free systems is given  figure 22 gives you a quick view of the performance of each positioning modality  the criteria we apply remain the same as the ones for device-based comparison  in terms of accuracy  cost  scalability  and energy efficiency  note that some systems only provide results such as room-level or location distinction accuracy ; we convert these results to our criteria approximately  in summary  every design of device-free indoor localization techniques possesses its own propose and scope  to pick out a positioning scheme for a specified application scenario  we can refer to this comparison diagram and choose the most suitable one  in the next section  we will discuss the open research issues for both device-free and device-based techniques  as with device-based localization systems  it is hard to quantify the effectiveness of a device-free localization system  factors such as deployment cost  energy efficiency  and scalability should also be taken into account when selecting the proper device-free localization scheme  in addition  as device-free localization systems rely on the human impact on wireless signals to detect and localize humans  they are more vulnerable acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:23 fig  23 performance comparison of all recent device-free approaches  to environmental interferences and dynamics  few studies have explored issues such as the rf interference from other existing wireless networks  environmental changes  e.g  furniture changes  may also require tedious recalibration for device-free localization systems to retain satisfactory performance  5 open research issues of the future the criticality of indoor localization has been admitted intimately and received a lot of attention and research  even so  many open issues still exist in the foreseeable future to meet all kinds of applications requirements  in this section  we aim at presenting these unfathomed issues faced when designing and implementing an indoor positioning system  specifically  we identify the corresponding ones in two categories  device based and device free  5.1 device based despite the considerable works that have been concerned about device-based indoor localization  including both commercial products and research-oriented solutions  important issues need to be further studied and addressed to keep pace with the requirements of different applications  modality selection  many devices like smartphones support multiple technologies that can be leveraged for localization  utilizing them all with data fusion is not a bad choice for high localization accuracy  but this is not necessary when energy efficient is preferred over accuracy  moreover  from the implementation perspective  the cost of the devices and infrastructure is also a concern in system design  therefore  efforts should be made to provide adequate selection of a localization modality based on application preference and requirements in order to balance the target among accuracy  energy  cost  and scalability  integration with device-free systems  since users may not carry devices everywhere in indoor environments  this can greatly improve user experience and provide convenience for object tracking  for example  in supply chain management  if device-based and device-free localization systems are seamlessly integrated  in fact  some projects  for example  the select project  select 2007   have explored designing a smart indoor wireless network where the detection  identification  and tracking of objects are integrated leveraging rfid  uwb  radar  and various data fusion techniques  this will facilitate future automatic identification  real-time localization and tracking  and user-friendly navigation and ambient intelligence on a unified platform  acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016  25:24 j xiao et al  infrastructure placement  while techniques like wifi and fm utilize signals of opportunities from already-deployed infrastructure  the placement of the infrastructure may not primarily be planned for localization purposes  consequently  the positions of the infrastructure can affect the system performance  and optimization of the infrastructure placement or additional assistant infrastructure deployment may be required to boost localization accuracy while retaining the networking or communication performance of wifi or fm devices  green localization  device-based approaches are dependent on hardware including smartphones  rfid tags  zigbee sensors  and so forth  while these devices have limited energy  frequent measurement will inevitably induce high power consumption  in fact  much previous work concentrates on accurate localization while neglecting the energy issue  or even achieves high accuracy by sacrificing power  however  such a sacrifice is not affordable for systems that are not easy to recharge like wireless sensor networks  or acceptable for devices that function otherwise like a smartphone  energy saving has recently drawn increasing attention driven by the trend of green computing  map construction  to localize and navigate a target in the real world  indoor maps are required  which describe the topology and size of rooms  corridors  elevators  and so on  currently  most of this map construction job is done manually  however  since the environment will change eventually  we have to continuously update the map  which is time consuming and labor intensive  crowdsourcing has proved to be a success in outdoor map construction by waze  and also has the potential to be used in indoor scenarios  currently  some works have been done by leveraging crowdsourcing to generate the indoor radio map  rai et al  2012   more efforts are still needed to ease the process of physical map construction and updating  5.2 device free from the previous review  we can see that many advances have been made in various research aspects on device-free indoor localization  including the well-studied wireless radar system  however  there are still many open research issues that need to be solved before the current technologies can be of practical use in not only military or industrial scenarios but also daily life  anomaly detection  while entities appearance or movement is usually not available for device-free techniques in advance as for the device-based ones  anomaly detection is a primary step for the subsequent localization  plenty of works have been done to address this problem  yet new approaches are still needed to better trade off between false alarm and miss detection  entity identification  it is challenging to figure out the type or identity of the entity being detected  like the height  shape  and so forth  however  to track a specific target  the system should be able to differentiate one target from all others  in computer vision  pattern recognition is commonly used to distinguish different objects  if we can connect each entity with a unique pattern extracted from the measurements  we will be able to discriminate them  multiple entities counting  the estimation problem of the number of entities arises in many real-world applications  especially when no assistant device is installed on the entities  for example  when conducting population statistics in retail and shopping malls for strategic advertisement arrangement  monitoring crowds in museums or residence communities for safety precaution or rescue operations  and performing flow control in high-density vocal concerts for security enforcement  some recent works explored counting moving humans using the percentage of nonzero elements acm computing surveys  vol  49  no  2  article 25  publication date  june 2016 a survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective 25:25  pem  metric in the csi matrix  xi et al  2014   yet it is still an open issue to count both static and moving targets using off-the-shelf wireless network infrastructures  multiple-entities localization  it is of great demand for many indoor ilbss to locate multiple objects at the same time  however  this is known to be much more challenging than single-object localization  in the multiobject case  more changes will be perceived in the indoor surroundings occupied by several objects  consequently  the severe multipath impression will give rise to many problems when applying device-free approaches  existing approaches for multiperson localization  xu et al  2013 ; adib et al  2015  mainly adopt a successive cancelation scheme to separate the impact of each person  yet require either a network of multiple links  xu et al  2013  or customized hardware  adib et al  2015   equipment deployment  the deployment of the device-free localization equipment in a specific indoor setting directly influences the positioning performance  for instance  moving the sensing node from ceiling to floor will result in different detection and localization accuracy  therefore  the positions of the equipment should be optimized to cover as large an area with as fewer dead spots as possible  extending location contexts  while device-free localization systems are primarily designed to localize humans without requiring the targets to carry any devices  such a device-free sensing modality has extended from detecting locations to richer contexts such as keystrokes  ali et al  2015   location-aware activities  wang et al  2014   and daily activities  wang et al  2015   however  it is still difficult to sense location-independent activities without per-person training using commercial wireless networks in a device-free manner  6 conclusion in wireless communications  increased attention and efforts foster improvement in a wide range of indoor ilbss  indoor localization  which is one of the most essential modules of ilbs  has become an open problem without a universally appropriate solution  in this article  we present the first in-depth analysis of the existing state-of-the-art research  divided into device based and device free  from the device perspective  in the device-based category  we mainly discuss different approaches that can be applied on a commercial smartphone  in a similar fashion  various systems for device-free indoor localization are reviewed  correspondingly  a comprehensive comparison for each category has
