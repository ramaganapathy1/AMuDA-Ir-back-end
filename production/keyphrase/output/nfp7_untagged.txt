indoor localization with low complexity in wireless sensor networks frank reichenbach and dirk timmermann  member  ieee institute of applied microelectronics and computer engineering 18119 rostock-warnemuende  germany  frank.reichenbach  dirk.timmermann  @ uni-rostock.de abstract autonomous localization of nodes in wireless sensor networks is essential to minimize the complex self organization task consequently enhancing the overall network lifetime  recently  precise indoor localization is impeded by multi path propagation of signals due to reflections at walls or objects  in this paper we partly overcome some of these problems by methods like frequency diversity and averaging multiple measured data  received radio signal strength  rss  in combination with weighted centroid localization  featuring low communication overhead and a low complexity of o  n   is our basis of a localization on the energy constrained sensor nodes  we first analyze the rss-characteristics on a specific sensor node platform in different rooms  next  we describe methods to improve these characteristics to reach best localization results at minimized complexity  finally  in a practice indoor localization we achieve a small localization error of only 14 % for 69 % of all test-points that was enhanced to at least 8 % in average by simple optimizations  for that  no hardware modifications as well as time consuming rssi-maps or complex signal propagation models are required  index termsindoor localization  approximate algorithms  received signal strength

 wsn   gathered information  e.g  temperature  humidity etc   is transmitted in a multi hop fashion over direct neighbors to a data sink  where the data is interpreted  1   with methods like self configuration and self organization the network reacts to node failures  wireless sensor networks enable new possibilities for timely detection of wood fire  monitoring of artificial dikes along a river  and precision farming  due to the desired nodes size of only some millimeters  the dimensions of the communication module and the battery are critical  consequently  the scarcest resource within a network is the available energy  2   therefore  achieving a long lifetime of the sensor network requires low power hardware and algorithms  beside the measuring task every sensor node must be able to forward packets and to compute different subtasks like crc-checking or data aggregation  this paper briefly analyzes an approximate indoor localization with a weighted centroid approach combined with signal strength measurements  we partially overcome some of the problems resulting by indoor signal propagation  our approach achieves a good precision without the need of time consuming creation of rssi-maps or complex probability models  this paper is subdivided as follows  in section ii  we give a basic overview about the methods for localization in wireless sensor networks  then a more detailed description about common methods in indoor localization follows  we continue explaining the weighted centroid localization algorithm  wcl  in section iii  next  in section iv  the received signal strength characteristic of our used hardware-platform is analyzed and optimized  followed by an adjustment of wcl  we continue showing the results of our practical indoor localization in section v after a detailed discussion of them in section vi we finally conclude the paper in section vii  ii  l ocalization in s ensor n etworks after deploying the sensor network over an area of interest  initially the sensor nodes have no position information  for several reasons a nodes position is very important  measurements without a location where they were gathered are generally useless  full covered sensor networks enable energy aware geographic routing  self configuration and self organization are key mechanisms for robustness and can easily be supported by position information  in many applications the position itself is the information of interest  at present a mobile device can be tracked outdoor and limited indoor by the global positioning system  gps   however  this system requires line of sight to some satellites  consumes additional energy and is too expensive to get integrated on hundreds of energy constrained sensor nodes  for this reason a small number of existing localization methods assume that some sensor nodes already know their own position  these nodes are called beacons or anchors  all other nodes in the network  without known positions  are further called unknowns  with known distances and/or angles between beacons and unknowns  the localization process starts  we classify algorithms into exact and approximate methods for localization  a exact localization exact localization of an unknown features high precision and is based on solving a linear system of equations with coordinates of the beacons and distances to them  with at least three beacons  required in 2-dimensions  unknown nodes estimate their positions via trilateration  more beacons than required result in an over determined system of equations that must be solved with e.g  a least-squares method  multilateration   due to complex and memory consuming calculations  exact methods are not suited to run on resource and energy constrained sensor nodes  3   nevertheless  savvides et al  describe different approaches  atomic  iterative  collaborative trilateration  for exact or also called fine-grained localization in wireless sensor networks  4   b approximative localization considering energy constraints in sensor networks created the group of approximate algorithms that consumes less power but estimates a position with a higher localization error  different approximate  also called coarse grained  localization approaches exist in the literature  tian et al  completely avoid distances in their approach  5   first  triangles are combined with all beacon coordinates in the field  then every unknown checks by a point in triangulation-test  pit-test  on localization algorithms exact approximated angulation trilateration multilateration fig  1 geometric proximity scene analysis basic classification of localization algorithms which triangle surface it is  in this pit-test only neighbor relations are used  a following intersection test with all filtered triangles shrinks the region where the unknown is probably located  in another approach by bulusu et al  every unknown maintains a list with all beacons in transmission range  the beacons are deployed on a grid of points with same distances to each other  6   with all received positions sent by the beacons  unknowns calculate the centroid as its own position  further approaches introduce constraints  7  or a relative coordinate system  8   c measuring observations with only few exceptions localization methods require observations to deduce distances from  these observations are gathered by different measuring techniques like e.g  time of flight  received signal strength  and differences of the phase  signals can be either radio  infrared  9  or ultra sound  10   reading the received signal strength indicator  rssi  is supported by almost every transceiverhardware that makes this to a beneficial solution  transmitted signals are attenuated in the communication channel between sender and receiver  thus  the rssi determined by the receiver is lower then the emitted signal by the sender  this dependency can be described among other models with the log-normal-shadowing model  rssi  d  = pt p l  d0  10 log10 pt p l  d0  d0 x = = = = = d + x d0  1  transmit power path loss for d0 reference distance path loss exponent gaussian random variable unfortunately  the received signal strength measurements are highly error-prone due to the following reasons  reflections of radio waves at obstacles cause multi path propagation  other electrical fields in the environment interfere the transmitted radio waves  the resolution of the received signal strength indicator can be limited by the transceiver hardware  the required line of sight between nodes can not be guaranteed  node mobility influences the measurement  d indoor localization with received signal strength 1  problem statement  the described multi path effect leads  especially indoor  to high measurement errors  reflections of electromagnetic waves at walls  objects or persons produce high fluctuations of the received signal strength  there exist different methods to reduce these errors  first  high redundant measuring is one of the basic procedures to eliminate outliers  second  there are two possibilities to reduce errors caused by reflections  antenna diversity or frequency diversity  antenna diversity means using two antennas that are placed 1/2 wavelength apart  because the extension of the null in space is restricted to a fraction of the wavelength  the probability for two nulls 1/2 a wavelength apart are very small  the receiver must switch between both antennas and use the one that at any time measures the strongest signal  frequency diversity means that the message is transmitted at two different frequencies separately  if there is a destructive interference at one frequency  it is not very likely that it will be destructive also at the other one  for the reason  that our used hardware platform supports two frequencies  we will gather information for two frequencies  2  related work  zhou et al  analyzed the effects of signal propagation in indoor environments and described different techniques to reduce the error  11   furthermore  elnahraway et al  tested different algorithms for localization in a typical ieee 802.11 network infrastructure with rssi  12   one of the most well known localization systems with signal strength in literature is radar  13   a very comprehensive overview about different localizations systems gave lymberopoulos et al  in  15   two approaches are commonly accepted in literature  rssi-maps and signal propagation models  many rssi-measurements at different locations in a building form a so called rssi-map which is stored on a node or on a base station  14    16    17   an unknown estimating its position compares the measured rssi-values with the entries in the rssi-map  the position with the most equal entry is then chosen  although the precision of this technique is relatively high  movements of objects or persons enforce a recreation of the map  which is very time consuming  as an alternative the signal propagation models have been established  12    18    19   the effects of indoor signal propagation are mapped in numerous propagation models  the measured rssi by the unknown is transformed by a formula to a corresponding distance  advantageously  the complex premeasurement is not needed  but the mapping of a real environment to a model is very difficult and not always appropriate  approaches with self learning algorithms enhance classical propagation models and increase the overall precision  21   however  these models require complex calculations on the unknown node  in our approach  we neither use rssi-maps nor propagation models  we first analyze the rssi-characteristics for our specific hardware at different locations  then  we reduce the locationdependent errors and adapt the curves to wcl  iii  background  w eighted c entroid l ocalization the following reasons motivated us to choose wcl as the algorithm for indoor localization  3   low memory allocation  low complexity o  n  allows distributed computation on every sensor node  high input errors  e.g  defective rssi or beacon coordinates  slightly decrease the precision  further  we describe the procedure of wcl  in order to do so  we define some variables  a sensor network with a total number of k nodes consists of u sensor nodes and b beacon nodes  b  u   beacons are equipped with more efficient hardware and a localization system  e.g  gps   whereby they are able to determine their own position  if the positions can not be determined via gps  which is in indoor scenarios more realistically  we deploy the beacons at known positions in the building  the algorithm is divided into two phases  a initialization phase in the first phase  all beacons broadcast their position bj  x  y  to all unknown sensor nodes within their transmission range  ideally  the transmission range is small enough to reach many unknowns  while receiving the packets  every unknown measures the received signal strength and stores it together with the position of the beacon  b distributed computation phase after all positions are gathered  the unknown estimates its approximate position p  xiapp  yiapp  by a weighted centroid determination for all n positions of the beacons in transmission range   n  wij  d  xbj j=1 n  p  xiapp  yiapp  = n      wij  d   j=1 n j=1 wij  d  n = = wij  d  ybj   wij  d     2  j=1 weight between sensor node i and beacon j number of beacons in range the weighted centroid determination considering distances di1  di4 results in the approximated position pi  xiapp  yiapp   figure 2 shows that distance di1 is higher weighted than di4 and significantly more weighted than distances di2 and di3  consequently  the approximated position moves considerable to b1  b4 and slightly to b2  b3 as well as to the exact position pi  xexact  yexact  and thus the estimation error fi  x  y  decreases  we postulated that distances are attained by observation values  due to interferences  obstacles  and hardware restrictions  the obtained distances are very noisy  hence  wcl uses distance information as a weight wij  small distances to neighboring beacons lead to a higher weight than to remote beacons  further  every coordinate of a beacons position obtains a weight depending on the distance wij  dij   the calculation of a weight by an rssi-value and their optimization is described detailed in section iv-a.2  the localization error fi  x  y  is defined as distance between exact position pi  xexact  yexact  and approximated position pi  xapp  yapp  of sensor node i  fi  x  y  =  xexact xapp  2 +  yexact yapp  2  3  figure 2 shows the exact pi  xexact  yexact  and the approximated pi  xiapp  yiapp  position of a sensor node determined by a weighted centroid calculation with positions of four beacons b1  b4  in different publications we analyzed the adjustment of the most important parameters in a multi hop case  21   iv  e valuation this section describes extensive analyzes of the signal strength characteristics of a sensor node platform in different environments in order to use rssi as input for a weighted centroid localization  b4 a hardware platform 1  chipcon cc1010 sensor node platform  as node platform we used modules of the type cc1010  868/915mhz  from chipcon  these modules feature low power consumption and a low transceiver sensitivity of typically -107dbm  the integrated 8051micro-controller allows simple calculations and the control of the transceiver hardware  we attempted to reduce transmitter/receiver variability and different antenna characteristics using the same standard antenna on every module  the evaluation modules  cc1010em  supported revision 3.0 and the evaluation boards  cc1010eb  revision 4.0 we encapsulated the cc1010em circuits in a chassis with additional modules and batteries to allow free movement  see figure 3   2  send power levels  the transceiver allows configuration

weight wij in the calculation process  3  received signal strength indicator  the evaluation module features measurement of the received signal strength in form of an rssi within the interval 50dbm rssi 110dbm  the rssi is determined by an analogue digital converter which converts the measured voltage over a 27k resistor  50db/v  which is in the interval 0v rssi 1.2v  we investigated that the sensor modules do not depend on the input voltage that makes the localization process more robust  4  frequency switching  the chipcon modules feature a simple frequency switching by software between 868.28mhz and 915.03mhz  we gathered sample data for both frequencies under the same test conditions  1 higher output power  > 5dbm  is supported by the hardware but produced no additional information in our test scenarios  the rssi always reached its maximum at -50dbm  -50 -50 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 0xa 0xb 0xc 0xd 0xe 0xf -60 -65 -70 -75 -60 -65 -70 -75 -80 -80 -85 -85 -90 0 50 100

the different output power levels ; outliers were decreased by averaging  room 1   b analyzing and optimizing rssi-measurements to get an idea of the rssi characteristics  we first gathered sample data in different measurement series  for that purpose  we mounted 5 evaluation modules on the evaluation boards  every node was given a specific identification number2  id   in all test setups node id 94 represents the unknown and node ids 63,77,78,89 represent the beacons  first of all  we measured the rssi on a straight line at different distances  to be able to detect location dependencies  we measured in 2 different rooms with different floor materials and objects within  the modules were placed on the ground  that was made of carpet  room 1  and linoleum  room 2   both rooms had a size of 7 5 meters  the measurement process at every distance step consists of rssi-data  at 2 frequencies  868mhz  915mhz   with 15 different output send powers  and 30 repetitions to calculate mean and standard deviation  the results for 2 beacons  sender  and always the same unknown  receiver  are illustrated 3 in the figures 4 and 5 every figure shows 2 the id originates from the last two numerics of the explicit hardware identification number  3 it is important to annotate that the standard deviation of all curves is marginal and was left out in the figures  moreover  we connected the resulting rssi samples to a line  which is indeed mathematically not correct  because every point is only a snapshot of the curve  both changes shall improve the viewers perspective  fig  7 relative localization error over the degree ; every curve represents different rssi-boundaries  the obtained rssi-curves over the distance at 15 power levels  the characteristics approximately correlate with the expected signal path loss curves to be obtained by  1   an increasing output power level at the sender results in an increasing rssi-value at the receiver  reflections in the room produce high outliers e.g  in figure 4 at 250cm or in figure 5 at 200cm  the outliers do not vary at the different power levels  the measured data scatter in a specific probability interval  the scattering depends among others on the already introduced influences  to determine the best value out of the stochastic values within the measurement interval there exist different operators for averaging  s  rssiav  d  = s t = = i=1 t  rssiij  d  j=1  s t   4  number of different power levels number of repetitions we decided to calculate the arithmetic mean in  4  to obtain the optimal rssi-value per distance  the standard deviation as an indicator for the quality of a measurement was not considered at present  because we do not need this value in the localization process  after averaging the curves for both frequencies  we derived 8 rssicurves  to illustrate  figure 6 shows the averaged curves for beacon averaging process  described in section iv-c  the unknown estimated its position via wcl  in further simulations we tried to enhance the precision by introducing rssi-boundaries  the reason for that is the insufficient differentiation after 200cm in room 2 thus  all rssi-values above a specific boundary were set to zero  there exist 52 rssi-values in the test scenario  arising from the corresponding distances from 13 test-points to 4 beacons  summarized  the rssi-value between a testpoint and a beacon that is above the boundary indicator-value was not considered in the localization process  the boundary ranged in simulations between 10 and 25 node 63 node 77 node 78 node 89 v e xperimental r esults 100 150 200 distance  cm  250 300 350 400 fig  8 averaged curves over different power levels and two frequencies for all four test nodes in room 2  77 although the outliers still exists  averaging both curves  for 868mhz and 915mhz  yield in more linear curves with less extreme outliers then before  this method was repeated for all nodes in both rooms resulting in one characteristic rssi-curve for every beaconunknown combination  see figure 8   summarized  relations between rssi and distance are qualified for localization input in the first room between 1cm and 350cm and in the second room between 1cm and 200cm  a differentiation of the rssi after these distances is almost impossible  recapitulating  the defective rssi-characteristics were enhanced by gathering more measurements and a simple averaging  so far  no hardware modification or complex computations were required  following  we consider the findings for a transformation of the rssi as weight in wcl  c adjustment of the weight in wcl in  3  we described an optimal weight for exact and for defective distances  now  we want to convert the rssi-values into a weight by starting to convert the original scale4 ranging from -110dbm to -50dbm into a standardized scale5 ranging from 1 to 61  rssistand  d  = rssi  d  + 49  5  the weight wij  d  must be inversely proportional to the standardized rssi-value because closer beacons to an unknown must have a higher weight then farther ones  in  21  we introduced a degree q to additionally vary the weights  w= 1 rssi q vi  d iscussion the experimental test setup basically showed the efficient function of wcl in an indoor environment  higher degrees pulled the unknowns too close to the beacons with short distances  on the other hand  if the degree was too small  e.g  q = 1   the estimated position moved in the centroid  a significant enhancement of the localization was reached by involving boundaries  this originated by the heavy defective rssi-values after 200cm  figure 8   the optimal configuration of all parameters  where the localization error reached its minimum  was determined at rssibound = 19 and degree q = 1 at this point most of the rssi-values in the localization process are accurate  it was shown in degree  all  6  d realization of an indoor localization in the previous sections we defined the basics for a practice indoor localization  next  the initial test setup will be described  our test field was quadratic with side length w = 300cm and build up in room 2 the sensor nodes were placed on the ground consisting of linoleum  some furniture  tables  chairs  stood next to the walls  the four beacons  id = 63  77  78  89  were placed at the four corners of the field with the positions b63  1  1  ; b77  300  1  ; b78  1  300  ; and b89  300  300   the unknown node  id = 93  was placed at 13 different positions  see figure 10   at every position the unknown run the measuring process described in section iv-a.2  2 frequencies  15 power levels  30 rss-indicators  for all 4 beacons  followed by the 4 the over degree q > 3 the relative localization error rised nearly linear  the localization error varied between 7.8 % f 26 % at different degrees ranging from 1 to 3  figure 7   the rssi-boundaries influenced the characteristics of the curves for q < 3 very strongly and controlled the number of rssi-values used in the localization  figure 9 illustrates the number of rssi-values used in the localization process  the minimal relative localization error  and the optimal degrees over different rssi boundaries  at a very low boundary  rssibound = 12  less than 15 out of 52 rssi-values were involved in the localization  with an increasing boundary an increasing number of rssi-values got involved  at rssibound = 19 and degree q = 1 the minimal relative localization error of f = 7.9 % was achieved  this optimal configuration used the half of all possible rssi-values  at rssibound = 20 the error reached its maximum  at the end of the curve  rssibound > 25  all rssi-values got involved in the localization and so the error stayed constant at f = 14.009 %  f = 14.7851 %  at a degree of q = 2  q = 3   whereas a degree of q = 1 dominated at lower boundaries  at higher boundaries the degree q = 2 dominated  value -110dbm represents a long distance between sender and receiver

14.16 % was achieved for 69.23 % of all test-points without optimization  additionally  the enhancement with boundaries decreased the relative average error to at least f = 7.9 %  the resulting error field is shown in figure 10 the error can be decreased with more beacons  especially one beacon in the centroid is very effective  because it can reach almost all unknowns under the 200cm boundary  further  the neighboring unknowns can interchange rssi-values to detect outliers  vii  c onclusion we showed in this paper that the approximate weighted centroid localization-algorithm in combination with received signal strength achieved in indoor environments a small localization error of 14 % for 69 % of all test-points  with optimization the averaged error was decreased to only 8 %  this result was obtained without the need of time and memory consuming rssi-maps or probability models  we first analyzed the characteristic rssi-curves for different indoor environments for 2 different frequencies  868mhz  915mhz   then  we reduced the location dependent errors and introduced a boundary under which the sampled data was qualified for localization  the wcl-algorithm features a low complexity of o  n   hence  wcl can be computed on energy constrained sensor node without exploiting them  acknowledgment this work was supported by the german research foundation under grant number
