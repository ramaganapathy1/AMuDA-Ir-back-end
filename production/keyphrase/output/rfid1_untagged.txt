which are in good agreement with measurement data  index termsantennas  passive modulated backscatter  radio frequency identification  rfid   tags  transponders  i introduction r adio frequency identification  rfid  is a rapidly developing technology which uses rf signals for automatic identification of objects  although the first paper on modulated backscatter  basic principle of passive rfid  was published in 1948  1  it took considerable amount of time before the technology advanced to current level  2   now rfid finds many applications in various areas such as electronic toll collection  asset identification  retail item management  access control  animal tracking  and vehicle security  3   several standards of rfid systems are currently in use  iso  class 0  class 1  and gen 2   globally  each country has its own frequency allocation for rfid  for example  rfid uhf bands are  866869 mhz in europe  902928 mhz in north and south america  and 950956 mhz in japan and some asian countries  a typical passive rfid transponder often called tag consists of an antenna and an application specific integrated circuit  asic  chip  rfid tags can be active  with batteries  or passive  batteryless   a passive back-scattered rfid system operates in the following way  a base station  reader  transmits a modulated signal with periods of unmodulated carrier  which is received by the tag antenna  the rf voltage developed on antenna terminals during unmodulated period is converted to dc  this voltage powers up the chip  which sends back the information by varying its front end complex rf input impedance  the impedance typically toggles between two different states  between conjugate match and some other impedance  effectively modulating the back-scattered signal  fig  1 illustrates a passive rfid system operation  proper impedance match between the antenna and the chip is of paramount importance in rfid  since new ic design and manufacturing is a big and costly venture  rfid tag antennas are designed for a specific asic available in the market  adding an external matching network with lumped elements is usually prohibitive in rfid tags due to cost and fabrication issues  to overcome this situation  antenna can be directly matched to the asic which has complex impedance varying with the frequency and the input power applied to the chip  several papers have been published on rfid antennas for both passive and active tags  including covered slot antenna design  4   circular patch antenna analysis  5   meander antenna optimization  6   planar inverted f-antenna  7   folded dipole antenna  8   etc  however  very few papers  9  provided an overview of criteria for rfid tag antenna design and an analysis of practical application aspects  at the same time  there exist many papers on practical analysis and design of particular classes of antennas used for other applications  10   12   in the current article  we attempted to fill the existing gap  we reviewed design requirements for passive uhf rfid tag antennas  outlined the design process  described range measurement techniques  and proposed a performance chart for tag analysis  we also presented a specific application example  a passive uhf tag design for a rfid tag placed on a cardboard box that is being tracked in standard supply chain  the design is a versatile loaded meander antenna which can be easily tuned for boxes with various content like dry goods or plastics  this example is supplemented with modeling and simulation results which are in close agreement with measured data  ii  antenna design a performance criteria the most important tag performance characteristic is read rangethe maximum distance at which rfid reader can detect the backscattered signal from the tag  because reader sensitivity is typically high in comparison with tag  the read range is defined by the tag response threshold  read range is also sensitive to the tag orientation  the material the tag is placed on  and to the propagation environment  the read range can be calculated using friis free-space formula as  1  manuscript received december 18  2004 ; revised june 8  2005

frequency for a typical rfid tag is illustrated in fig  2 the frequency of the peak range is referred as the tag resonance  the tag range bandwidth can be defined as the frequency band in which the tag offers an acceptable minimum read range over that band  from  1  one can see of the reader that read range is determined by the product  transmitter eirp   tag antenna gain  and transmission coefficient  typically is dominant in frequency dependence and primarily determines the tag resonance which happens at the frequency of the best impedance match between chip and antenna  this frequency is different from the resonant frequency of antenna loaded with 50 ohm and the antenna self-resonance  the range in  1  can be normalized with a factor 4  this factor is the range of the to

they are labeled with their values normalized to  the chart in fig  3 can be used as a common reference frame to present the performance of any rfid tag antenna similar to impedance presentation of a

of rfid tag in example given in this article is also shown  on a smith chart  the same range can correspond to several gain-transmission coefficient combinations  the rfid tag antenna design process involves inevitable tradeoffs between antenna gain  impedance  and bandwidth  the performance chart in fig  3 helps the designer to estimate the range tradeoff between the impedance matching and the gain  the normalization factor for this performance chart can be easily calculated for any case of eirp and threshold power of the chip for a given frequency  3872 ieee transactions on antennas and propagation  vol  53  no  12  december 2005 b design requirements several general rfid tag design requirements whose relative importance depends on tag application are discussed in the following paragraph  these requirements largely determine the criteria for selecting an rfid tag antenna  1  frequency band  desired frequency band of operation depends on the regulations of the country where tag will be used  2  size and form  tag form and size must be such that it can be embedded or attached to the required objects  cardboard boxes  airline baggage strips  identification cards  etc   or fit inside a printed label  3  read range  minimum required read range is usually specified for different  eirp  eirp is determined by local country regulations  objects  tag performance changes when it is placed on different objects  e.g  cardboard boxes with various content   or when other objects are present in the vicinity of the tagged object  tag antenna can be designed or tuned for optimum performance on a particular object or designed to be less sensitive to the content on which the tag is placed  orientation  read range depends on antenna orientation  some applications require a tag to have a specific directivity pattern such as omnidirectional or hemispherical coverage  4  applications with mobility  rfid tag may be used in situations where tagged objects like pallets or boxes travel on a conveyor belt at speeds up to either 600 ft/min or 10 mph  the doppler shift in this case is less than 30 hz at 915 mhz and does not affect rfid operation  however  the tag spends less time in the read field of rfid reader  demanding high read rate capability  in such cases  rfid system must be carefully planned to ensure reliable tag identification  5  cost  rfid tag must be a low-cost device  this imposes restrictions both on antenna structure and on the choice of materials for its construction including the asic used  typical conductors used in tags are copper  aluminum  and silver ink  the dielectrics include a flexible polyester and rigid pcb substrates like fr4  6  reliability  rfid tag must be a reliable device that can sustain variations due to temperature  humidity  stress  and survive such processes as label insertion  printing and lamination  c design process rfid tag antenna performance strongly depends on the frequency-dependent complex impedance presented by the chip  tag read range must be closely monitored in the design process in order to satisfy design requirements  since antenna size and frequency of operation impose limitations on maximum attainable gain and bandwidth  13    14  compromises have to be made to obtain optimum tag performance to satisfy design requirements  often a tunable antenna design is preferable to provide tolerance for tag fabrication variations and for optimizing antenna performance on different materials in different frequency bands  fig  4 rfid tag antenna design process  rfid tag antenna design process is illustrated on a flow chart shown in fig  4 once the rfid application is selected  system requirements can be translated into tag requirements  these requirements determine the materials for tag antenna construction and asic packaging  the impedance of the selected asic in a chosen rf package  like flip-chip  etc   to which antenna will be matched can be measured with a network analyzer  antenna parametric study and optimization is performed until design requirements are met in simulation  like most antennas  rfid tag antennas tend to be too complicated for analytical solution as they can be used in complex environment  tag antennas are usually analyzed with electromagnetic modeling and simulation tools  typically with method of moments  mom  for planar designs  e.g  thin flexible tags  and with finite-element method  fem  or finite-difference time-domain method  fdtd  for more complicated three-dimensional designs  e.g  thick metal mounted tags   fast em analysis tools are crucial for efficient tag design  in a typical design process  modeling and simulation tools can be benchmarked against measurements  read range calculation can be implemented directly in em software  tag antenna is first modeled  simulated  and optimized on a computer by monitoring the tag range  antenna gain  and impedance which give to a designer a good understanding of the antenna behavior  in the last step of the design process  prototypes are built and theirperformanceismeasuredextensively.ifdesignrequirements are satisfied  the antenna design is ready  otherwise  the design is further modified and optimized until requirements are met  d range measurement accurate tag range measurement can be conducted in a controlled environment  such as anechoic chamber or transverse electromagnetic  tem  cell  in both methods tag position can be fixed and transmitter output power can be varied by controlled rao et al   antenna design for uhf rfid tags  a review fig  5  3873 rfid tag range measurement using anechoic chamber  fig  7 rfid conveyor belt application  boxes are equipped with smart labels and being tracked  where is the height of the tem cell at the cross-section where rfid tag is placed and is tem cell input impedance  in our measurements  we used an anechoic chamber with 3 ft  0.91 m  distance to the tag and 6.2 dbi linearly polarized 220 mm and reader antenna  the tem cell had parameters 50 ohm  cable loss was 0.5 db in both cases  iii  rfid example a application fig  6 rfid tag range measurement using tem cell  attenuation  this allows one to carry accurate tag range characterization and avoid using large and prohibitively expensive chambers or cells  compact tem cell is a convenient tool for measuring small tags while larger anechoic chamber can be used to measure tag performance on various objects  in anechoic chamber  the tag is placed at a fixed distance from the reader antenna as illustrated in fig  5 required to at each frequency  the minimum power of communicate with the tag is recorded  since the loss of the transmitting antenna the connecting cable  the gain and the distance to the tag are known  the tag range for any transmitter eirp of interest can be determined from  1  as  3  the general guidelines for selecting the tag position in anechoic chamber are the following  i  the distance must be such that the tag will respond and will be in far field and ii  the tag must be placed in a quiet zone of the anechoic chamber where multipath is minimal  in tem cell  the tag is placed inside  and the cell is connected to rfid reader with variable output power as illustrated in fig  6 at the input of at each frequency  the minimum power tem cell required to communicate with the tag is measured  tag range can be calculated from known expressions for the field inside tem cell  15  as  4  consider a specific application  a smart label for cardboard box labeling in warehouse environment worldwide  such a label with a bar code printed on it and an rfid tag embedded underneath can be placed on cardboard boxes with various contents  boxes may travel on a conveyor belt as shown in fig  7 or may be moved through large portals by forklifts equipped with rfid readers  requirements to the tag design are the following  tag should be easily tunable to any frequency in 860960 mhz range for various contents in the final assembly when the tag is inserted into a label and placed on a cardboard box  tag should have at least 2.5 m range with 4 w eirp in 915 mhz band  902928 mhz frequencies  us  and at least 2.2 m range with 2 w erp  3.3 w eirp  in 868 mhz band  866869 mhz frequencies  europe  to meet worst case application requirements  tag should fit into a standard 6 4 inch label  it is desirable to have as small footprint as possible to fit into 4 2 inch and 4 1 inch labels for other potential applications  it is preferred to have omni-like read range performance for a tag  b antenna design the process of antenna design is briefly described below  materials  because of cost and application considerations  it was decided to use for the antenna a thin flexible polyester substrate with a dielectric permittivity of 3.5 and a thickness of 2 mil  0.051 mm   top antenna trace was made of copper and had a thickness of 0.7 mil  0.018 mm   3874 ieee transactions on antennas and propagation  vol  53  no  12  december 2005 table i parameters of the loaded meander tag antenna  mm  fig  8 rfid chip affixed to antenna terminals using flip-chip packaging  fig  9 geometry of the loaded meander tag antenna  asic  for this smart label application  we used philips epc 1.19 g2 rfid asic chip  16  mounted on antenna terminals as shown in fig  8 using flip-chip packaging  17  which has been widely established as a popular low-cost technique  the input impedance of the packaged chip was measured in the frequency domain with the network analyzer for different power levels  it was determined with rfid reader that the minimum power needed by the chip to turn on is 10 dbm  which agreed with manufacturer specifications  antenna type  the antenna geometry is shown in fig  9 because of the size and tunability requirements  meandered dipole antenna was a natural choice  meandering allowed the antenna to be compact and to provide omnidirectional performance in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the meander  to have a better control over the antenna resistance  we added one loading bar with the same width as the meander trace  to provide a better match for the chip capacitive impedance  one meandered section was further meandered to obtain additional inductance  this antenna can be easily tuned by trimming  lengths of meander trace and loading bar can be varied to obtain optimum reactance and resistance matching  the trimming is realized by punching holes through the antenna trace at defined locations  such tunable design is desirable where it is often needed to provide a solution for a particular application with a minimum lead time  parametric study and optimization  the loaded meander antenna has several key parameters  loading bar width  distance  spacing  meander step width  and meander step height  maximum allowed antenna length is dictated by the size requirements  the pa fig  10 impedance of the loaded meander tag antenna  r  x  as a function of meander trace length trimming x tag resonance is determined by the best match with the chip impedance  r  x   1 rameters mentioned above influence antenna gain and impedance which determine tag resonance  peak range  and bandwidth  this thin planar antenna was optimized using ansoft designer  tag range was computed from and impedance  1  using simulated values for gain and measured values for chip impedance at the threshold power  although ansoft software had a powerful parametrics and optimization engine  its post-processing capabilities were not sufficient to create an adequate cost function for our design requirements  the optimal realizable combinations of tag antenna parameters were identified by plotting and examining the families of curves  after optimization  we arrived to the final parameter values for tag antenna given in table i antenna reactance and resistance can be controlled by trimming as it is illustrated in fig  10 for example  mm moves trimming the meander trace by the resonant frequency up by 20 mhz  the gain is not significantly affected by trimming as it is shown in fig  11 the performance of the untrimmed tag is also shown on the chart in fig  3 prototyping and validation  several tag prototypes similar to the one shown in fig  12 were fabricated and tested in both anechoic chamber and tem cell range measurement setups  fig  13 presents a comparison between theoretical and experimentally measured read range for one of the tags tuned to 915 mhz band in free space  it can be seen that theoretical curve and experimental data are in close agreement  differences between tem cell data and anechoic chamber data are due partially to imperfections of anechoic chamber and partially to electric field nonuniformities inside tem cell  rao et al   antenna design for uhf rfid tags  a review 3875 fig  14 variations of rfid tag range versus frequency for different samples due to asic packaging process variations erp 2 w   =

experimental read ranges for loaded meander rfid tag in free-space eirp 4w   =  sensitivity to chip variations  tag design must meet range requirements in spite of variations in asic assembly and packaging process  because all fabrication details may not be known in advance  the tag resonant frequency after fabrication may differ significantly from the expected value  to provide sufficient tolerance for tag resonant frequency  our meander antenna is designed to resonate in free-space with a typical chip impedance shown in =   =  fig  10 at about 855 mhz  this ensures that when the tag is placed on the box  it covers the lowest rfid band  866869 mhz  even if fabrication process causes significant resonant frequency deviation  the tag antenna can always be trimmed to a shorter length whereas extending its length after the fabrication is not easy  after the prototypes were fabricated  it was found that the spread of the tag resonant frequency is about 20 mhz as shown in fig  14 this spread was caused by the flip-chip attachment process which affected the package parasitics and added variations to the imaginary part of the packaged chip impedance  sensitivity to box content  when the tag is placed on a cardboard box with some content  its resonance frequency shifts down but the tag can be trimmed and tuned to the proper frequency and range performance as shown in fig  15 the corresponding trimming of the meander trace and the loading bar is shown in fig  16  3876 fig  16 ieee transactions on antennas and propagation  vol  53  no  12  december 2005 meander tuning for various box content in 868 mhz band  once the tuning is determined  it can be applied to all tags destined to work for specific box content in specific frequency band  the presented tag design meets the desired range requirements for various box contents in both 868 mhz and 915 mhz frequency bands  iv  conclusion radio frequency identification is a rapidly developing technology for automatic identification of objects  in this paper  we presented an overview of antenna design for passive uhf rfid tags  we discussed various requirements to such designs  outlined a generic design process including range measurement techniques  and concentrated on one practical application  rfid tag for box tracking in warehouse  we presented a loaded meander antenna design for this application and

a review and a practical application yuri tikhov in  1   the authors discuss the generic design process for passive uhf radio frequency identification  rfid  tag antennas  the attempt to formulate the key universal criteria for the tag antenna design looks really interesting  in this connection the most important characteristic of every uhf rfid system is a read range r the maximum practical distance between an interrogator base station  reader  and a transponder  tag   accordingly  the basic considerations are focused on the read range formula given in  1  as  1  r=  4 p t gt g r pth  1  where  is the wavelength  pt is the power transmitted by the reader  gt is the gain of the reader antenna  gr is the gain of tag antenna  pth is the minimum threshold power necessary to provide enough energy feeding for the tag chip  and is the power transmission coefficient due to the impedance mismatch between tag antenna and chip  indeed  the far-field formula  1  is correct subject to assumption that polarization of reader antenna and the polarization of tag antenna are perfectly matched  but in fact  the polarization mismatch is essential in most rfid applications  the point is that in the majority of applications the tag is allowed to appear in almost arbitrary position in the field of the reader antenna  actually in  1  authors mention the problem of tag orientation  but just in the specific context of a directivity pattern  however  the polarization issue becomes also critical  and the polarization of the tag antenna is usually linear because of pre-required small size of the tag  in such situation the only way to fulfill a system requirement is to use circularly polarized reader antenna  thus  a sacrifice of 3-db power loss due to polarization mismatch between circularly polarized reader antenna and linearly polarized tag antenna overcomes the problem of tag orientation  this is why nowadays the major vendors  such as  2   5  and many others  offer mainly circularly polarized reader antennas  at the same time the linearly polarized antennas are also available in the market for limited rfid applications  in the case of linearly polarized both reader and tag antennas  the substantial polarization misalignment may cause severe power loss which in its turn can potentially lead even to fault of rfid system at all  therefore  considering polarization issues  in order to avoid overestimation of the read range the formula  1  needs revisions  definitely  in the most conventional case of circular-to-linear polarization mismatch the read range r should be  1= 2  times shorter  in the case of linear-to-linear polarization mismatch the decay factor is a function of the variable misalignment angle  the chart in  1  fig  3  should be corrected accordingly  p manuscript received december 10  2005 the author is with the samsung advanced institute of technology  suwon 440-600  korea  e-mail  tikhov @ sait.samsung.co.kr   digital object identifier 10.1109/tap.2006.875933 besides  it is worth mentioning that formula  1  is invalid at nearfield distances between reader and tag  and the near-field situation can frequently happen in practical uhf rfid application scenario  regardless of above-mentioned inaccuracy  the qualitative value of the work  1  can be definitely very helpful for designers of passive uhf rfid tags

 we agree that polarization mismatch is an important factor in communication links  3   we also would like to point that  1  gives the maximum distance in free space at which rfid reader can detect the backscattered signal from a given tag which implies that both reader antenna and tag antenna are oriented towards each other in the direction of maximum gain and their polarizations are matched

june 2006 where 1 ej # and 2 ej # are the complex polarization ratios of the reader antenna and the tag antenna  the absolute value  of the antenna polarization ratio is related to the antenna axial ratio a  measured in decibels  as a = 20 log +1  01  3  there are several special cases of interest for rfid applications  when both antennas are linearly polarized and oriented with a misalignment angle  the polarization efficiency is p = cos2  when the reader antenna is circularly polarized and the tag antenna is linearly polarized  p the polarization efficiency is 1=2 which decreases the read range by 2 as correctly pointed out by dr tikhov  dr tikhov also mentions that  1  is invalid at near-field distances  we agree with that but would like to emphasize again that  1  gives the maximum distance at which rfid reader can read the tag in free space  in most uhf rfid systems  this distance extends well into the far-field zone  this is reflected in the very form of  1  which uses friis free-space transmission formula valid only in the far-field region  5   while some tag application scenarios involve near-field tag scanning  1907 it can be expected that in most cases the tag which can operate in the far field should receive more than adequate power to operate when brought closer to rfid reader antenna into the near field  hence  the read range of most uhf rfid tags is determined by the tag performance in far field  we would like to thank dr tikhov for his valuable comments  1  which helped to clarify some aspects of our work  2  and make it more useful
