adaptive distance estimation and localization in wsn using rssi measures abdalkarim awad  thorsten frunzke  and falko dressler autonomic networking group  dept  of computer sciences  university of erlangen martensstr  3  91058 erlangen  germany dressler @ informatik.uni-erlangen.de abstractlocalization is one of the most challenging and important issues in wireless sensor networks  wsns   especially if cost-effective approaches are demanded  in this paper  we present intensively discuss and analyze approaches relying on the received signal strength indicator  rssi   the advantage of employing the rssi values is that no extra hardware  e.g  ultrasonic or infra-red  is needed for network-centric localization  we studied different factors that affect the measured rssi values  finally  we evaluate two methods to estimate the distance ; the first approach is based on statistical methods  for the second one  we use an artificial neural network to estimate the distance  index termswireless sensor network  distance measurement  network-centric localization  rssi i introduction a ccording to moore 's law  each year electronic devices become cheaper and smaller  connecting huge numbers of small embedded systems  one is able to create powerful massively distributed systems  the best-known examples are wireless sensor networks  wsns   such sensor networks consist of a number of sensor nodes  possibly reaching hundreds or thousands of connected devices  each node is a small computing device  which has the capability of sensing and computing in addition to the ability to communicate with other nodes  wireless sensor networks represent one of the emerging research domains  there are many applications for wsns in military domains but also in civil applications such as habitat monitoring and emergency applications  in this paper  we study and discuss short ranged rssi based distance measurement and localization methods and possible improvements for a mobile robot  we introduce two methods for distance estimation based on the rssi value ; the first approach is a statistical method and the other one is based on a trained feed forward artificial neural network  for experimental tests  we developed a prototype using btnode sensor nodes1 and the mobile robot system robertino.2 one single btnode is connected on top of the robot acting as a base station of the wsn  this has the main advantage that we can rotate and move the base station as well as changing the rf parameters during our measurements  thus  we can investigate 1 2 http  //btnode.ethz.ch/ http  //www.openrobertino.org/ the influence of antenna orientation  signal strength  and local disturbances on the distance estimation in more detail as if we would use a static base station  additionally  the robot is supplied with a database of fine-grained rssi/distance pairs that have been gathered by performing many calibration runs  ii  related work in the last few years  several approaches have been presented for indoor localization as well as for outdoor use  maybe the most famous localization method is to measure the time of flight  tof  of radio frequency  rf  signals  which is for example used in gps systems  usually  this method can not be applied in wsn due to the short distance and the much too inaccurate time synchronization of the sensor nodes  cricket motes exploit this fact and send rf and ultrasonic signals assuming the rf signal has no delay and measure the tof for the ultrasonic signal  9   radar is a user tracking system  2   it uses empirical as well as mathematical models to determine the signal strength  calamari uses rssi and acoustic tof to estimate the distance  11   it uses an audible frequency to reduce the complexity of the system  spoton is a rssi based ad hoc localization system for wsns  4   it can be used for relative and absolute position determination  in this system  all the nodes need to be calibrated before being used  motetrack focuses on a robust  decentralized implementation  7  as the most localization systems need a base station for data processing  the majority of the nodes take over only a limited role in the localization process to support the case that one or more base stations are down  additionally  the localization of mobile systems has been addressed  5  10   iii  considerations on rssi based distance estimation all signal strength-based localization systems  in particular indoor  must consider errors in the measured values  which result from multi-path propagation  reflection  and fading effects  at the execution time of the first measurements  there is limited relation between the rssi value and the real distance  in addition  there is a set of influencing factors  which can be controlled and exploited for improved measurement results  a antenna characteristics and orientation the used antennas are regarded to forming sources with d experimental setup our lab is an area of 5x8m with desks  workstation computers and shelves  see fig 1   in the middle there is a free area of about 3.5 x 5.0m  our experiments take place here  since our main focus is to examine short range rssi deviations under standard conditions for indoor localization  keeping the overall applicability in mind   fig 1 in the lab environment  a great number of objects may influence the radio transmission in our lab  we are using btnode sensor nodes  which employ a bluetooth interface and a 433-915mhz low power radio chip cc1000  the nodes are equipped with an atmel atmega128l microcontroller running at 8mhz and 128kbyte flash memory  for our measurements  we also used the mobile robot system robertino  this robot carries a pc104 board running linux  it is able to perform all the localization algorithms de a statistical aspects first  we examined the characteristics of the rssi  for the chipcon cc1000  the rssi is recorded with an analogue signal  01.2v  that is inversely proportional to the input signal level  using a frequency of 868mhz  the readings from the ad converter can be converted to dbm  vrssi  v  = adc x 2.56v / 1024 p  dbm  = -50.0 x vrssi 45.5dbm we used the robot to request some data packets with arbitrary distance and saved the respective rssi values  in this experiment  the distance between the robot and the sensor node was 2.2m  first  the rssi values were observed for a time period of 120s  histogram of received rssi values in duration of 120s 112 76 62 60 number of packets 80 100 110 41 40 c variation of the frequency small changes of the wavelength can lead to different developments of the fading effects caused by reflection  thus  the dispersions caused by inappropriate frequency under the given basic conditions must be considered  therefore  also the observation of the signal strength under different frequencies is a subject of the accomplished experiments  iv  distance measurements 20 b variation of the transmission power the transmission power and the frequency determine the maximum range of the radio waves  while the maximum transmission power might be appropriate for long distance communication  disregarding energy requirements   differences in the rssi are hardly visible for small distances between transmitters and receivers  however  the measurement of short distances for the localization in closed areas with small dimensions is important  thus  the transmission power must be wellcontrolled for meaningful rssi based distance measurements  scribed in this paper  for communication with the sensor network  we attached a btnode to the top of the robertino  8 6 0 0 spherical radiation  typically  signals are sent in the frequency range between 868 mhz and 915 mhz  thus  the antennas are about 8.3 cm  /4  long  usually  it is assumed that the signals on their way from the transmitter to the receiver spread in all directions equally otherwise  measurements of the mutual orientation would have to be admitted  since we can not determine mutual orientation but we do assume the fact that the orientation directly exerts influence on the rssi  a method is needed to compensate the orientation effects  10 15 20 0 25 0 30 4 35 0 1 40 rssi fig 2 variation of the rssi values over 120s in fig 2  it is to be recognized that the measured values vary strongly under identical conditions  it is noticeable that from the range of rssi values between 15 and 45 actually only 9 different values were measured  it is to be therefore assumed that the resolution of the rssi does not cover the complete range of values  a further problem is that in two minutes only very few packets are sent  the bottle neck is the packet processing in the sensor node  in another experiments it showed up that a transmitter can send between 170 and 180 packets in 30 seconds  the packet size  maximum 255 byte + 7 byte header  does not influence the speed  therefore  it must be examined whether the evaluation of fewer rssi values is statistically relevant  in a second attempt under identical conditions  we measures rssi values over 20s  see fig 3   the comparison of both histograms shows differences in the distribution of the rssi values  nevertheless  the statistical properties need to be considered  a comparison of the statistical data shows that both measurements exhibit similar characteristics as depicted in table i for the localization system it is crucial that a small number of measurements supplies relevant results  since we need data from many different nodes  rssi values for a distance of

rssi values change with different distances  the past results suggest that small number packets can supply meaningful results  therefore  in each experiment we used 60 packets to determine the rssi values for distances of 1m and 3m  this range was selected to judge the relevance of indoors locations  the measurement environment was a hall in our sports center  a smaller range of the rssi values is to be expected according to fewer reflection surfaces compared to our lab  the expected decrease of the range of values did not appear in the changed environment  see fig 4 and fig 5   we assume that the quality of the used antennas caused this strong dispersion  one recognizes besides that the distance difference of 2m has little influence on the measured rssi values  a comparison of the statistic data of both series of measurements confirms this impression  with 3m  a tendency is recognizable toward the higher rssi values  however  this change is so small that inverse mapping of the rssi on the distance would be connected with a large error  c adjustment of the transmission power without modification  btnode transceivers use a frequency of 868 mhz and a maximum power of 5 dbm

localization  the transmission power should be adapted to cover the complete rssi  so that one can expect sharp demarcations also between small distances  if the transmission power is regulated to the lowest value  -20 dbm   then the effective range lies below 1m  which is too small for distance measurement purposes  in an experiment  we compared a medium transmission power  -4 dbm  to the full transmission power as used before  again  we measured distances of 1m and 3m  from fig 6 and fig 7  it could be recognized that there is a clear shift of the range of values toward the higher rssi  especially for the 3m experiment  the desired effect occurred  the statistics show clear changes in the recorded values  however  we will describe later that a simple interpolation between two reference values is not sufficient to reach an adequate illustration of the rssi on the distance  d adjustment of the frequency in the next attempt  two different frequencies of 863.5mhz  0.3474m  and 869.9mhz  0.3449m  are compared regard rssi values for a distance of 1 m  transmission power=-4dbm 16 16 standard deviation  it is clear that the higher the standard deviation the more uncertainty

measurements were done automatically by the robot  it drove over a distance of 5m in steps of 50cm toward a sensor node  in each step  it requested 60 packets on the two frequencies and stored the rssi values  the results are depicted in fig 8 and fig 9 during this experiment  a high standard deviation is recognizable in the range between 2.0 and 3.0m for the lower frequency  thus  the median is less meaningful regarding the distance  even if it rises almost straight-lined over a wide range with increasing distance  the minimum represents a much better distance indicator  the rssi values of the higher frequency exhibit a smaller difference between maximum and minimum for each individual step  the standard deviation of this series of measurements is small for all distances  with exception of the first and last hops minimum and median ascend with increasing the distance  two further series of measurements  which were accomplished with higher transmission power however under the same conditions  exhibited a very similar pattern regarding the 3 distance  m  rssi 100 50 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 distance  m  fig 10 rssi values measured during rotation e change of orientation in the past experiments  the orientation of the robot and thus the alignment of the receiver node relative to the transmission f smoothness of rssi measurements a further important aspect is the resolution of the rssi  in order to evaluate the quality of the rssi to distance mappings  measurements must be done in much smaller steps  in the following experiment  the distance increment of the robot is reduced to 10cm per step resulting in altogether 50 measurements  each one for 60 packets  additionally  the robot rotated with each measurement around its axis  the results as depicted in fig 11 show that it needs about 0.5m to see somewhat higher rssi values  in all measurement groups  a strong increase of the standard deviation and the maximum rssi can be observed  these values should not be considered for the compensation calculation  250 rssi median minimum standard deviation 200 rssi 150 100 50 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 distance  m  fig 11 rssi measures using 10cm step size in the ranges between 0.5m and 1.0m as well as between 3.5m and 5.0m  the rssi hardly contains information about the distance  the measured value stagnates or oscillates without a tendency  however  between 1.0m and 3.5m  the measured values seem to be meaningful  median  and quantiles  the average value appears however as less suitable  since only small packet quantities are regarded and  thus  arising peaks could distort the result  therefore  we used only the minimum  the median  and the 25 % quantile  if we want to describe the measured rssi values functionally  we need an illustration  which represents as exactly as possible the distances for measured rssi values  for this function the statistic data of the rssi form the input and the associated distance the output  in our experiments  we recognized that the data can be best described by a linear or exponential function as shown in fig 12  250 rssi median minimum standard deviation lin  regression exp  regression 200 150 rssi node was always the same  since a localization procedure needs data from many sensor nodes  which may stand in arbitrary alignment to the robot  we needed to examine whether the change in the orientation of the sensor node changes the rssi values  it turned out that the standard deviation increased in the case of rotation  during each measurement  the robot rotated 180 to the left then 360 to the right ; finally it goes back on the starting position  this rotation finally leads to a substantial advantage  fig 10   using again the minimum of the rssi measures  it is possible to overcome orientation effects while the standard deviation of the measured values obviously increased  thus  the experiment shows that a measurement without consideration of the orientation would be incomplete  100 50 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 distance  m  fig 12 linear and exponential regression based on the median of the measured rssi values b estimation using artificial neural networks  anns  anns are biologically inspired classification algorithms  they try to simulate the human brain  our brain consists of about 10 billion neurons ; each neuron connected to about 10,000 other neurons through dendrites  inputs  and axons  output   at each neuron  the inputs are to be summed  if the summation of the inputs is greater than a threshold  then the neuron fires  and an output signal to the next neuron is generated  the inputs have different effects on the outputs depending on the synapse so some inputs have excitatory effects and others have inhibitory effects  the strengths of the inputs is determined by the weights in ann  feed forward artificial neural networks perform signal processing without possible feedback  thus  the signals flow from the inputs to the outputs of the network through several layers of neurons  v distance approximation in order to approximate the distance between two nodes  we compared two methods as discussed in the following  a linear and exponential regression the method for distance estimation is based on the comparison of the characteristics of descriptive data  e.g  the average  fig 13 a single processing element in anns the neuron is the basic processing element ; the output of the neuron is a function of the inputs as shown in fig 13 wi is the weight  and b is a bias  which is corresponding to the thre b

the weights are to be determined in the learning process  this learning is either supervised or unsupervised  samples with inputs and outputs are needed in the supervised leaning  while in the unsupervised are only the inputs needed  in this paper  we used supervised learning to train the network to estimate the distance based on the rssi values  so the inputs are rssi values and the output will be the estimated distance  back propagation is the common used learning method in feed forward neural network  the error is to be back propagated to adjust the weights to reduce the error between the actual output and the estimated output  our neural network is implemented using matlab  we used an ann with 60 inputs and one hidden layer with 20 neurons and one output  the sigmoid function is employed as activation function for hidden layer and liner activation function for output layer  the weights and biases are optimized using the levenberg marquardt optimization method  2 1.5 b  1.12

section  we show the applicability of the rssi based distance measurement for localization  the basic localization method as used in our experiments is multilateration  due to the limited space  we only describe the basics of trilateration  i.e  multilateration based on three measurements  afterwards  a number of experimental results are provided  a trilateration if we need to estimate the location of a node based on known node  the position of this node is computed by the solution of a set of equations  the most common localization algorithm is the trilateration as depicted in fig 1 if the distances are known to at least three reference objects  one can set up a system of circle equations  given the positions of three known anchor nodes mi=  xi  yi   the following equation system must be solved to get the search position p=  ux  uy    ux  x1  2 +  uy  y1  2 = r12  ux  x2  2 +  uy  y2  2 = r22  ux  x3  2 +  uy  y3  2 = r32 fig 1 trilateration in r2 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3

the location information for position a using 4  5  6  or 7 anchor nodes  respectively  as can be seen  the localization quality is quite high  actually  position a represents a typical example for

2  worst case  position b the position computation for position b is based on a maximum of six instead of seven distance estimations  the localization process is completely automated and it may occur that any node is unavailable for the distance measurement process  we did not correct this consciously  since in the reality the occurrence of node failure is not rare  table iv shows the distance estimation and fig 4 depicts the corresponding average localization  obviously  the quality of the distance measurement is comparably bad in this example  the average distance estimation error is about 0.8m resulting in high localization errors  interestingly  the distance estimation using the ann approach is much better in this example  nevertheless  in average  both methods produce estimations with the same quality and error range  3  best case  position d position d supplies the best results despite high dispersion over the averaged coordinates of all calculated positions  table v shows the results for the distance estimations for position d in this case  the regression method provides distance estimations with an average error of less than 0.5m  this result is quite encouraging compared to measures that can be found in the literature  in this specific case  the ann was not able to produce high quality estimations as the average estimation error was about 1m  we need to further study possible combinations of the statistical regression methods with fuzzy approaches such as the ann  finally  fig 5 depicts the localization quality for the best case measurement

said that a huge number of parameters must be considered for high quality distance estimation and  therefore  localization in wireless sensor networks using the received signal strength indicator  in particular  we identified the following parameters  which affected the distance measurement to a certain degree  the used transmission power the radio frequency the node orientation  i.e  antenna characteristics the localization algorithm the quality of the reference measurements based on these findings  we developed an adaptive testbed for distance measurements and localization experiments  in our opinion the most important factor for proper distance estimation is to choose a transmission power according to the relevant distances  if the power is too high the rssi differences between different distances are not significant enough for a good interpretation if it is chosen too small far-field effects take place for short distances already leading to calibration data containing only little distance information  it is also important to take care of the chosen frequency for the localization setup  our experiments have shown that some frequencies are more vulnerable to disturbances than others  but it can be assumed that this observation is individual for different orientations and positions of the robot in the test setup  therefore it is desirable to compare the measurements of different frequencies not only prior but also during the localization to get the best possible results  depending on the quality of the antennas a rssi based localization system must also take the bi-directional orientation of sensor-nodes into account  on the other hand we made the experience that the localization algorithm itself and the preparation and interpretation of calibration data does
