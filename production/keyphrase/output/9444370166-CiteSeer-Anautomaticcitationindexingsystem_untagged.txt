which is an automatic citation indexing system  citeseer provides most of the advantages of traditional  manually constructed  citation indexes  e.g  the is1 citation indexes  io    including  literature retrieval by following citation links  e.g  by providing a list of papers that cite a given paper   the evaluation and ranking of papers  authors  journals  etc  based on the number of citations  and the identification of research trends  citeseer has many advantages over traditional citation indexes  including a more up-to-date database which is not limited to a preselected set of journals or restricted by journal publication delays  completely autonomous operation with a corresponding reduction in cost  and powerful interactive browsing of the literature using the context of citations  citation indexing a citation index  6  indexes the links between articles that researchers make when they cite other articles  citation indexes are very useful for a number of purposes

academic articles are used to give credit to previous work in the literature and provide a link between the `` citing '' and `` cited '' articles  a citation index  6  indexes the citations that an article makes  linking the articles with the cited works  citation indexes were originally designed mainly for information retrieval  7   the citation links allow navigating the literature in unique ways  papers can be located independent of language  and words in the title  keywords or document  a citation index allows navigation backward in time  the list of cited articles  and forward in time  which subsequent articles cite the current article ?  citation indexes can be used in many ways  e.g  a  citations cnn help to find other publications which may be of interest  b  the context of citations in citing publications may be helpful in judging the important contributions of a cited pa per and the usefulness of a paper for a given query  7  141  c  a citation index allows finding out where and how often a particular article is cited in the literature  thus providing an indication of the importance of the article  and d  a citation index can provide detailed analyses of research trends and identify emerging areas of science  8   existing citation indexes the institute for scientific information  isi   io  produces multidisciplinary citation indexes  one is the science cita tion i~ & x @  sci   intended to be a practical  cost-cffectivc tool for indexing the significant scientific journals  the isi databases are valuable and useful tools  a recurrent criticism 89 against the is1 databases is that they are biased because of the management decisions of isi  with respect to the selection of the items which arc indexed  s   other is1 services include keywords plus @ 171  which adds citation information to the indexing of an article  keseurch alert 8  which provides weekly listings of citations related to a set of key references 181  and bibliographic coupling  which allows navigation by locating papers which share one or more references  8   a universal citation database citeseer will not disambiguate name  we expect that citeseer over time due to the collection mcnt of the algorithms used in two authors with the same will improve in this regard of databases and improveciteseer  the advantages of citeseer compared to the current commcrcial citation indexes include  because citeseer can index articles as soon as they are available on the web  it should be of greater use to researchers for finding recent relevant literature  and for keeping up to date  citeseer is autonomous  requiring no manual effort during indexing  citeseer can be used to make a more informed estimation of the impact of a given article  citations do not always imply scholarly impact  2  4  9  12  171  and citeseer helps by making the context of citations easily and quickly browsable   the following sections describe the document acquisition  document parsing  identification of identical citations  and database query/browsing  document acquisition cameron proposed a universal bibliographic and citation database which would link every scholarly work ever written 131 he describes a system in which all published research would bc available to and searchable by any scholar with internet access  the database would include citation links and would be comprehensive and up-to-date  perhaps the most important difference between cameron 's vision of a universal citation database and citeseer is that citeseer does not require any extra effort on the part of authors beyond placement of their work on the web  citeseer automatically creates the citation database from downloaded documents whereas cameron has proposed a system which requires authors or institutions to provide citation information in a specific format  a second relevant difference is that citeseer exists whcrcas cameron 's system is only a proposal that presents significant difticulty for implementation  additionally  citeseer can extract the context of citations  improving literature search and evaluation  citeseer citeseer downloads papers that are made available on the world wide web  converts the papers to text  parses them to extract the citations and the context in which the citations are made in the body of the paper  and stores the information in a database  citescer includes algorithms for identifying and grouping variant forms of citations to the same paper  citeseer also performs full-text indexing of the articles and citations as well as providing support for browsing via citation links  papers related to a given paper can be located using common citation information or word vector similarity  given a particular paper of interest  citeseer can display the context of how the paper is cited in subsequent publications  this context may contain a brief summary of the paper  another author 's response to the paper  or subsequent work which builds upon the original article  compared io the current commercial citation indexes  the citation indexing performed by citeseer has the following disadvantages  i citeseer does not cover the significant journals as comprehensively  we expect that this will be less of a disadvantage over time as more journals become available online  agreements with the publishers would be required to index most journals   2 citeseer can not distinguish subfields as accurately  e.g  citeseer can be used to create a comprehensive index of literature on the web  or to create indexes of a user-specified topic  there are many ways in which citeseer can locate papers to index  e.g  a web crawler could be used similar to the web search engines  the location information could be extracted from the announcements of papers in usenet message groups or mailing lists  or citeseer might index new issues of journals as they are made available  under agreement with the publisher   currently  citeseer uses web search engines  e.g  altavista  hotbot  excite  and heuristics to locate papers  e.g  citeseer can search for pages which contain the words `` publications ''  `` papers ''  `` postscript ''  etc   citeseer locates and downloads postscript files identified by `` .p '' ''  `` .ps.z ''  or `` .ps.gz '' extensions  urls and postscript files that arc duplicates of those already found are detected and skipped  document parsing the downloaded postscript files are first converted into text  wc currently use prescript from the new zealand digital library project  http  //www  nzdl  erg/technology/ prescript  html   the text file is checked to verify that the document is a valid research document by testing for the existence of a references or bibliography section  citeseer detects and reorders postscript files that have their pages in reverse order  the following information is extracted from the documents  url  the url of the downloaded postscript file is stored  l 90 l header  the title and author block of the paper is extracted  ahsrruct  if it exists  the abstract text is extracted  introductiot~  if it exists  the introduction section is extracted  citations  the list of references made by the document are extracted and parsed further as described below  citutinn umte.vt  the context in which the document makes the citations is extracted from the body of the document  fill/ text  the full text of the document and citations is indexed  l l and page numbers roughly 40 % of the time  the low number for page numbers detected is probably due  at least partially  to the fact that many citations did not contain page numbers  l l l table 1  citation parsing performance for a sample citeseer database  due to the wide variation in the formatting of document headers  not all sublields  title  author  author affiliation  addresses  etc   are reliably detected  we plan to improve the parsing of document headers using tither additional heuristics or machine learning techniques  once the set of references has been identified  individual citations are extracted  each citation is parsed using heuristics to extract the following fields  title  author  year of publication  page numbers  and citation tag  the citation tag is the information in the citation that is used to cite that article in the body of the document  e.g  ``  6  ''  ``  giles97  ''  `` marr 1982 ''   the citation tags are used to find the locations in the document body where the citations are actually made  allowing us to extract the context of these citations  the heuristics used to parse the citations were constructed using an `` invariants first '' philosophy  that is  subfields of a citation which had relatively uniform syntactic indicators as to their position and composition given all previous parsing  were always parsed next  for example  the label of a citation to mark it in context always exists at the beginning of a citation and the format is uniform across all citations  once the more regular features of a citation were identified  trends in syntactic relationships between subfields to be identified and those atrcady identified were used to predict where the desired subfield existed  if at all   for example  author information almost always precedes title information  and publisher almost always is after the title  we also use databases of author names  journal names  etc  which are used to help identify the subfields of the citations  parsing of natural language citations is difficult  i   however  we have been able to achieve reasonably good results using heuristics to extract certain subfields  table t shows parsing statistics for a sample citeseer database which was created from 5093 documents related to `` neural networks ''  we plan on using learning techniques and additional heuristics in order to extract additional fields of the citations  note that we have not attempted to exhaustively index all papers found on the web in this area  we can see that the titles and authors can be found in citations roughly 80 % of the time identifying citations to the same article citations to a given article can be made in significantly different ways  for example  the following citations  extracted from neural network publications  are all to the same article  c71 l breiman  j.h  friedman  r.a olshen  and c.j  stone  classification and regression trees  wadsworth  pacific grove  california  1984  6 l breiman  j friedman  r olshen and c stone  classification and regression trees  wadsworth and brooks  1984 cl1 l breiman et al  classification and regression trees  wadsworth  1984 much of the significance of citeseer derives from the ability to recognize that all of these citations refer to the same article  this ability allows  a detailed listing of a cited article to show all instances of the citation across multiple articles  statistics on citation frequency to be generated  allowing the estimation of the importance of articles  more accurate identification of sub-fields for a citation  e.g  errors or incomplete fields in one instance of a citation may be resolved from analysis of the group of citations to the same article  more accurate identification of sub-fields for a citation leads to more accurate estimation of statistics based on fields  e.g  the citation frequency for authors  as suggested by the example citations above  the problem is not completely trivial  we have investigated three methods of identifying citations to identical articles and grouping them together  along with a simple baseline method for comparison  for all of thcsc methods  we found that normalizing certain aspects of citations tends to improve the results  wc have used the following normalizations  i conversion to lowercase  2 removal of hyphens  3 removal of citation tags  e.g  131   giles 921 at the beginning of the citation  91 expansion of common abbreviations  e.g  conf  -+ conference  proc  + proceedings  common abbreviations for the following words arc currently expanded  conference  proceedings  international  society  transactions  and technical report  removal of extraneous words and characters which may occur in some  but usually not all  instances of a citation  the following words are removed  pp  pages  in press  accepted for publication  vol  volume  no  number  et  al  isbn  the following characters are removed  &     i the methods we tested for identifying citations to identical articles are as follows  1 baseline simple  a simple baseline method which iterates through all citations  for each citation  we find the maximum number of words which matches with a previous citation  normalized by the length of the shorter citation  if this number exceeds a threshold then the new citation is considered to be a citation to the same article as the previous citation  and the new citation is grouped with the previous citation  otherwise  a new group is made for the citation  2 word matching  1 giles 1 recurrent 1 fuzzy 1 average 1 1 number of citations ' baseline simple word matching word & phrase matchmg llkelt 233 i 12 % 13 % 10 % 22 % 371 9 % 8 % jr lllr i 941 i ii7c 9 % 9 % 17 % io 7 % 10.0 % 7.7 % 16.7 % table 2  results for grouping identical citations with normalization  results are the percentage of groups in the correct grouping for which the automated grouping is not 100 % correct  not 100 % correct  the results are shown in table 2 the average percentage of the correct groups which were not 100 % correct in the automated grouping were  from best to worst  word and phrase matching 7.70/o  word matching lo.o %  baseline simple 10.7 %  likeit 16.7 %  note that an error of lo %  for example  does not imply that 10 % of citations are not grouped correctly  e.g  the addition of one incorrect citation to a group marks the entire group as incorrect  likeit currently performs poorly  one explanation may be that two citations to the same article can be of significantly different lengths  likeit does not currently support a containment operation  `` is a contained in b ? '' rather than `` is u equal to b ? ''  although there are plans to add such an operation  alternatively  string distances may not be a good paradigm for determining the semantic similarity of citations  or we may not be using the likeit distance in the best manner  likeit considers citation strings at the level of letters instead of words  and the order of letters  and thus words   both of these factors contribute to string differences which may not correspond to semantic differences  query and browsing an algorithm similar to the baseline simple algorithm which first sorts the citations by length  from the longest to the shortest  3 word and phrase matching  the word matching algorithm where sequences of two words within each subfield arc also considered as terms in the matching process  i.e  this algorithm takes into account some of the ordering of the words  which is ignored by the previous algorithms  separate thresholds are used for the single word and two word matches  4 like/f  a method based on the likeit intelligent string comparison algorithm introduced by yianilos  19  181 likeit is an sophisticated form of edit distance which tries to build an optimal weighted matching of the letters and multigraphs  groups of letters   likeit provides a distance measure between two citations  we use likeit in the following way  the citations are ordered by length  from longest to shortest  and we iterate through the citations  for each citation  we tind the group with the smallest likeit distance  if this distance is below a threshold then the citation is considered identical and added to the prcvious group  otherwise a new group is created  in order to cvaluatc the algorithms  we created three sets citations taken from the neural network literature  corrcsponding to queries for the terms `` giles ''  `` recurrent ''  and `` fuzzy ''   these sets contained 233  377  and 941 citations respectively  we manually grouped the citations such that each group contained citations to the same paper  we ran the above algorithms on these sets and computed an error score for each case  the error score is the percentage of the groups in the correct grouping for which the automated grouping is 0t the first query to citeseer is a keyword search  which can be used to return a list of citations matching the query  or a list of indexed articles  the literature can then be browsed by following the links between the articles made by citations  figure i shows a sample response for the query `` dempster '' in a citeseer database of neural network literature  a list 01 citations matching the query are shown  ranked by the number of citations to them  once an initial keyword search is made  the user can browse the database using citation links  the user can find which papers are cited by a particular publication and which papers cite a particular publication  including the context of those citations  figure 2 lists the papers which cite the first article in figure i  along with the context of the citations  obtained by clicking on the appropriate  details  link in ligurc i   an example of full text search in the indexed articles is shown in figure 3 here the header information is given for documents which contain the keywords conjugate and gradient  details of a particular document can bc found by choosing the link  details   the details for a sample document is shown in figure 4 the header  abstract  and list of references made by this document can be seen  92 citeseer home options i $ & feedback _ citations matching dempster citations 76 article dempster  a  laird  n  rubin  d 1977 muximum likelihood from incomplete data via the em ai  gorithm  journal of the royal statistical society  series b  39  l  38   details  dempster a.p   i 967  upper and lower probabilities math  statis  38  325-339   dcld_i !

distance measure used  currently  we use only the top 20 components of each document for computational masons  however there is evidence that this truncation may not have a large effect on the distance measures  151 string distance citeseer uses the likeit string distance  181 to measure the edit distance between the headers of documents in a database  the header of a document is simply all of the text in a document before the abstract  or the introduction if there is no abstract   the header tends to contain items such as the document title  author name and affiliation  and possibly the publication venue  likeit tries to match substrings in a larger string  common authors  institutions  or words in the title will tend to reduce the likeit distance between headers  the premise behind the use of likeit is that the document header contains very important information about the document  and that the presence of words in similar arrangements indicates documents of similar origin  single words  and even phrases to a lesser degree  may not have much power to represent the topic of or concepts discussed in a research paper  citations of other works on the other hand  arc hand picked by the authors as being related documents  it seems intuitive then to use citation information to  judge the relatedness of documents  citeseer uses common citations to make an estimate of which documents in the downloaded database of research papers are the most closely related to a document picked by the user  this measure  `` common citation x inverse document frequency ''  ccidf  is analogous to the word oriented tfidf  151 word weights  the algorithm to calculate the ccidf relatedness of all documents in the database to a document citations ot interest ,4 and choose the best 1\/1documents is  i assign a weight  sw   to each citation i  equal to the inverse of the frequency of the citation in the entire database  2 determine the list of citations and their associated weights for document a and query the database to find the set of n documents  b    j = 1 n which share at least one citation with a  3 for each j = 1  .71  determine the relatedness of the document rj as the sum of the weights of the citations shared with a r  = c w  ie/mieh   2  4 sort the r  values and return the documents bj with the 1vi highest rj values  as in the use of tfidf  ccidf assumes that if a very uncommon citation is shared by two documents  this should be weighted more highly than a citation made by a large numbei of documents  although we have not formally measured the performance of ccidf  we have found it to be useful  and to perform better than the word vector or likeit based automatic similar document retrieval methods  combination of methods although we have found that citation based similar document retrieval is subjectively better than word vector or likeit based retrieval  we plan to more thoroughly evaluate the performance of ccidf and compare with other techniques  such as the word vector and edit distance methods presented here  95 block jacobi preconditioning of the conjugate gradient method on a vector processor markus heglandand paul e

product distance between we intend lo include the use of more specific citation information to judge distance between documents  for example  in addition to common papers  citation of the same authors or .journals may indicate a relationship  b  the heuristics used to locate articles could be improved  e.g  the modification frequency of pages could be used to set an interval which is used to check for updates to a page and relevant ncwsgroups and mailin  0 lists could be monitored in order to index new papers as soon as they are announced  c  the database could bc augmented m order to maintain user feedback on each article  e.g  comments or questions regarding the artlclc  followup comments or responses from the author or other-s  or rankin g information  d  citesecr could easily bc cxtcnded in order to keep track of topics documents  and articles that user-sare interested in  users could then be automatically informed when new articles are indcxcd which match their interests  for cxamplc  profiles could be kept for topics which a user is interested in  the profiles could be updated autonomously by watchmg user actions  e.g  the downloading of a particular document   or they could be updated with relevance feedback  alternatively  users may register papers of interest so that they can bc informed of new articles which cite these papers  summary citeseer is an autonomous citation indexing system  citeseer is different from previous citation indexing systems in that the indexing process is completely automatic  citeseer autonomously locates  parses  and indexes articles found on the world wide web  the advantages of citesccr include 97 timeliness  automation  and browsing of citation context  the system indexes preprints and technical reports  as well as journal and conference articles  the publication delay for journals and conferences means that citeseer has access to more recent articles  this allows scientific effort to progress more rapidly  and reduces the possibility of performing work which has already hcen done by others  the system is completely automatic  and dots not require human effort in the indexing process  due to the organization of the web  citeseer is not currently able to provide as comprehensive an index as the traditional systems because many publications are not currently available on-line  this is changing rapidly however  and wcexpect that this disadvantage will disappear over time  also  because of potential difficulties  for example in the automatic identification and disambiguation of authors  the citeseer index may not bc as accurate as traditional manual indexes  however  citeseer may allow a human to assessthe accuracy of results  by browsing detailed information and citation context in the database  more easily than with traditional citation indexing systems  some of the most important capabilities of citeseer arc  a  the ability to parse citations from papers and identify citations to identical papers that may differ in syntax  this allows the generation of citation statistics and the grouping of work which cites a given paper  b  the ability to extract and show the context of citations to a given paper  allowing a researcher to see what others authors have to say about a given paper  and c  the ability to find related articles based on common citations and on word vector
