rfid system consists of two components  the transponder  or tag  and the detector  or reader   the rfid tags are categorized as either passive or active ones  a passive tag possesses a coupling element and a small  inexpensive electronic microchip  operating without a separate external power source  it is activated only when situated within the interrogation range of a reader  which supplies required power to the transponder through the coupling unit  an active rfid tag  on the other hand  is powered by an internal battery to enable a longer operating range  albeit to a larger size and higher price  currently  the rfid reader chip can be made very tiny in size  smaller than a us quarter  21   with low power  such an rfid reader chip is designed to equip portable electronic devices  e.g  smart phones  pdas  and so on  with rfid technology  it is expected that diverse applications will be developed out of such small sized rfid gear  object localization is one of the most important applications of the rfid system to determine the rough trajectory of a moving target or the presence of an object  6    20    23   it is usually realized by deploying rfid tags and/or readers at known positions to compute the possible location  j maneesilp is with the pollution control department  ministry of natural resources and environment  bangkok  31/8 soi.19  ngamwongwan rd  bangkrasor  maung

workshop  when an object with an rfid tag passes the reader  the system detects the rough location of the object  alternatively  if a set of rfid tags are placed at known locations as reference points  a person carrying a portable electronic device with an embedded tiny rfid reader  or a robot equipped with an rfid reader  13    25    27   can obtain rough location information according to the responses of nearby reference tags  while locating rfid tags is better known  positioning rfid readers can gain importance when tiny rfid reader chips are popularly embedded in smart phones  or other portable electronic devices   an expected technological development trend  in particular  given the fact that readers are much more reliable than tags  such positioning technology may be applied for security and safety monitoring  for example  if an individual carrying a smart phone with an embedded rfid reader walks close to a dangerous area  e.g  a radiation or restrictive zone   an alert/alarm will be raised immediately  the problem of rfid localization on 2d planes has been investigated extensively  4    13    14    15    17    19    22    25   while increased attention is given to positioning in its 3d counterpart  8    9    23   the localization approaches largely fall into two categories  7   distance-based  dis  also known as range-based  and range-free  raf   a dis technique is based on estimated distances between transponders  or tags  and detectors  or readers   10   such a technique often suffers from low accuracy in distance estimation due to complex environments and dynamic channel conditions  as a result  two raf positioning schemes  i.e  a passive and an active ones  are considered here  doing away with distance estimation altogether  our passive scheme locates an rfid tag  which is attached to the target object  based on a nelder-mead nonlinear optimization method to minimize error objective functions using rfid tags and readers deployed as the reference points  it is  published by the ieee computer society 1448 ieee transactions on computers  thus  named as the nelder-mead nonlinear optimization scheme  first introduced in our prior publication  23    on the other hand  our active scheme locates an rfid reader  with only rfid tags as the reference points and without other devices or sensors  like video cameras  odometers  built-in distance  angle sensors  and so on  exemplified in  13    14    15    19   for localization support  it follows an iteration process  dubbed decision boundary optimization  deb   aiming to determine a sphere model  which is the best fit of the activated reference tags such that the sphere center is the estimated target position  being raf  our both localization schemes avoid the need of distance estimation according to received wireless signal strength  known to be notoriously inaccurate   9    13  or phase difference  being complicated   3    5    8   consequently  their accuracy levels are expected to be independent of the types of readers  which often exhibit different radiation patterns   moreover  our active scheme is less expensive than earlier ones  which rely on localization support of other devices or sensors  13    14    15    19  to achieve desired positioning accuracy  and faster in coordinate calculation than other methods  which call for repeated activation of nearby tags to progressively reach desirable localization accuracy  6    25    27   in this work  we consider a hexahedron space in which target objects are to be localized  we carry out analyses  extensive simulations  and testbed experiments by using the alien rfid kits  1    2  to evaluate the proposed localization schemes  both schemes meet the desired accuracy requirement  i.e  to limit the error of the coordinates to less than 5 percent of the longest edge of the hexahedron  of applications such as 3d packaging and tracking in containers or storage rooms  the errors are mainly due to asymmetric antenna gains  limited radio ranges  significant multipath fading  unreliable signal transmission  irregular coverage by readers interrogation signals  called coverage irregularity  as also shown in the sensitivity and orientation chart of aln-9540 squiggle passive tags  1    and border/corner effects commonly existing in rfid systems  which together lead to various degrees of false positive reads  that detect tags outside the presumed interrogation range  and false negative reads  that miss tags inside the interrogation range  in rfid systems  to further enhance localization accuracy  we exploit multiple antennas  in contrast to the use of multiple readers or mobile readers   as detailed in section 3.4 note that it is common for an rfid reader to support multiple antennas  for example  an alien technologys alr-9900 reader  employed in our testbed experiments  provides four antenna connectors  2   moreover  we propose tag compensation to deal with wall adversary  as to be discussed in section 5.2 the rest of this paper is organized as follows  section 2 discusses related work  section 3 introduces our proposed passive and active 3d positioning schemes  simulation and testbed experimental results are presented in sections 4 and 5  respectively  finally  section 6 concludes the paper  2 related work in tandem with widespread adoption of rfid due to reduced ownership costs  the need of localizing rfid gear rises as well  location information is usually critical for rfid applications  prompting investigation into different vol  62  no  7  july 2013 positioning techniques  20   mostly for locating tags  in general  those techniques may be dis or raf  where the former relies on distance estimation between a tag and the reader  often making use of received signal strength or phase difference from tags  and the latter counts on tags  which respond upon receiving interrogation signals from the reader  employing received signal strength  9    17   a dis technique is suitable for locating active tags  whose signal strength indications received by the reader can be discriminated  when based on reception phase difference  a dis technique needs multiple readers/signals  3    5  or supplemental devices  like pan-tilt units  8   in additional to rfid gear  meanwhile  a dis technique was considered previously  5   where the rfid reader transmits multiple signals with different fundamental frequencies to active tags  a tag then emits backscatter modulated signals  which are received and demodulated by the reader to calculate the distance to the tag based on received signal strength information  the use of phase difference for rfid tag localization has been exploited recently  involving softwaredefined radio receivers and a pan-tilt unit for experimental evaluation  8   however  the complexity of algorithms for reception phase calculation is high and an additional pantilt unit for accuracy improvement leads to an expensive method  separately  location identification based on dynamic active rfid calibration  landmarc   17  deploys a set of active rfid tags at designated locations as references  it utilizes a small number of readers  each with several transmission power levels  based on proximity information of detected reference tags  landmarc estimates the location of a tracking active tag  17   able to achieve accuracy in the order of a meter only  in contrast  raf techniques are applicable to both active and passive rfid tags  with the latter deemed advantageous due to their low costs  long durability  small footprints  and no energy losses  raf techniques have been explored for wide applications  including autonomous robot navigation and warehouse management  4    6    13    25    27   such a technique employs the rfid reader to activate nearby tags  which report their existence  and perhaps their stored data as well   it can detect the target tags within the readers interrogation signal ranges  of more than 30 feet for aln-9540 squiggle tags  1   based on our measurement   when the rfid reader is attached to an autonomous robot for navigation  raf techniques can be followed to enhance location information  6  by detecting its nearby reference tags placed inside a building  able to greatly lower the time needed for global localization of the mobile robot  similarly  mobile robot selflocalization was achieved using an rfid reader mounted on the robot to scan the prearranged tags with the support vector machine scheme  27   the preceding two cases  6    27  consider the localization of readers carried by mobile robots  another raf technique localizes passive rfid tags by utilizing the characteristic curves of tag reads and writes at different signal attenuation levels and at different distances  25   in addition  several recent studies on mobile robot localization relied on the use of raf techniques together with other devices or on-robot sensors  like video cameras  odometers  built-in distance  angle sensors  and so on  to achieve better positioning accuracy  14    15    19   note that all known raf techniques  except for our prior work  23   are for 2d localization  maneesilp et al   rfid support for accurate 3d localization in wireless sensor network  wsn  systems  location information with coarse accuracy is sufficient for most applications  therefore  several raf localization approaches have been proposed  7    10  as cost-effective alternatives to expensive range-based approaches  the raf techniques in wsn also perform well under random node placement and irregular signal pattern  separately  effort has been placed on localization and positioning in general wireless networks  15   aiming to guide routing and facilitate information gathering  for example  a self-configurable positioning mechanism for multihop wireless networks was treated earlier  26   the cricket location support system  18  and the active badge location system  24  have been developed by employing ultrasonic technology to provide location information  like raf techniques  all those localization mechanisms for wireless and sensor networks  however  are limited to 2d localization systems  2.1 earlier nelder-mead localization  nem  scheme an earlier localization scheme has been treated in  23   where nelder-mead nonlinear optimization is followed to minimize the error objective functions  called the nem scheme  in such a scheme  the reader situated inside a 3d hexahedron activates part of the reference tags placed at known positions on the ceiling and the floor planes  23   nem first builds two circles  one on each plane  to approximate the shapes of the activated tags in 2d  before finding the radius and the center of each circle via nonlinear optimization  the x and y coordinates of the rfid reader are estimated using the center points of the two circles  each circle center is at a point whose distances to chosen activated tags are as close to one another as possible  obtained by minimizing the distance variation function  in other words  nem carries out distance optimization over a 2d plane first  to get the circle center according to chosen tags on the plane  be the ceiling or floor plane   deemed as the 2d optimization phase  outlined next   once the centers on both planes are obtained  the z coordinate of the reader can be calculated accordingly  different approaches toward choosing reference tags for coordinate calculation are studied  including the inner border method  ibm   full border method  fbm   and solid circle method  scm   23   a simplex method is employed to find the center  xf  yf  0  and radius rf of the circle formed by the chosen set of reference tags  depend on the chosen methods  i.e  ibm  fbm  and scm  on the floor  then  an error objective function is defined  and the nelder-mead simplex optimization is then followed to minimize the defined error objective function  the center  xc  yc  0  and radius rc of the circle on the ceiling can be derived similarly  then  x and y coordinates of the reader are determined by averaging  xf  yf  and  xc  yc   and the z coordinate is obtained from rf  rc  and the height of the hexahedron  this earlier considered nem scheme will be compared with the schemes proposed here in sections 4 and 5  3 proposed 3d localization schemes we propose two rfid-based 3d localization schemes  namely  a passive scheme and an active scheme discussed in the following sections  the proposed schemes are for locating an object with reference to a predetermined 1449 arbitrary coordinate system  they are raf  employing rfid gear alone without additional devices or sensors  without loss of generality  we consider a hexahedron space  like a shipping container  a storage room  or other hexahedronshaped spaces   whose length  width  and height are l  w  and h  respectively  in the rest of this section  we first discuss the challenges and our main contributions  our passive and active localization schemes are then described in sequence  followed by discussion on accuracy improvement for our active localization  3.1 challenges and contributions the basic idea of localization in rfid systems is to employ reference points to help determine the position of the target  for example  to locate an rfid reader  reference tags must be deployed in the system  based on the responses from them  the coordinates of the reader can be derived  earlier work  6    11    20  is mostly built upon simplified system models  for example  the wireless signal propagation is usually assumed ideal  such that the rfid reader can communicate with any tag within a perfect sphere centered at the reader and with a radius equal to its standard interrogation range  such assumptions greatly simplify the complexity of localization  however  our preliminary experiments have revealed that they do not hold in a real environment  leading to challenges summarized below     due to the asymmetric antenna gain and multipath fading  signal transmission from the reader does not form a perfect sphere  see fig  6  for example   without this assumption  straightforward geometric calculation can not be applied  it becomes more challenging when the reader operates near a side/corner or other obstructions  where only partial and irregular responses from reference tags can be obtained  as shown in fig  11c   communication in rfid systems exhibits low reliability even under static environments  tags do not always respond to reader scanning  leading to unexpected holes often observed in our experiments  as depicted in fig  11   3.2 passive scheme the proposed passive scheme aims to locate an rfid tag  which is attached to the target object  using rfid tags and readers as reference points with known coordinates  the nelder-mead nonlinear optimization scheme is employed to minimize the error objective functions  although its initial setup cost is high due to the need of a set of rfid readers as reference points  the passive scheme is capable of localizing multiple targets simultaneously  especially suitable for tracking inexpensive target objects in a small space for delay-insensitive applications  3.2.1 localization system description the passive scheme for 3d localization is illustrated in fig  1  where the reference tags with known coordinates are placed only on the ceiling  or the floor  of the hexahedron.1 1 note that this is the minimum requirement  one may deploy more reference tags on other sides of the hexahedron to enhance accuracy  1450 ieee transactions on computers  vol  62  no  7  july 2013 fig  2 three-dimensional positioning scheme  fig  1 three-dimensional passive positioning scheme  in addition to the reference tags  n 4 rfid readers are deployed on the ceiling  usually at the vertices or edges   as to be discussed later  deploying more readers may increase accuracy  but result in a longer computing time and a higher cost  the passive scheme requires the readers with multiple transmission power levels  here  each rfid reader is assumed to have k transmission power levels  which are calibrated so that there is a linearly increasing response range with the increase of power level  the reference tags and readers are placed appropriately with their accurate coordinates stored either in the tags and/or readers or in a database maintained by a local server  3.2.2 tag coordinate calculation upon receiving the request for locating one  or multiple  rfid tag  s   all readers scan the target tag  s  and report the gathered information of activated tags to a computer for coordinate calculation  more specifically  the readers start with the lowest power level and gradually increase the transmission power until they receive the response from the target tag.2 at the same time  each reader also receives the responses from reference tags  let k denote the set of rfid tags which send responses when the reader uses power level k let us consider a reader i and a target tag j if j 62 k and j 2 k1  the distance between i and j  denoted by lij  can be estimated by averaging the distances from the reader to all reference tags that are in k1 but not in k  after a set of approximate distances from the target tag j to the n readers  i.e  l1j  l2j     lij    lnj are collected  the location of the tag j is determined by minimizing the error function using the nelder-mead nonlinear optimization  which is defined as ! 2 n x lij  l^ij  1 '' lij i1 here  xi ; yi ; zi and xj ; yj ; zj denote the coordinates of reader i and target tag j  respectively  thus  the distance from reader i to the tracking tag j is represented by q 2 l^ij xi  xj 2 yi  yj 2 zi  zj 2  2 linear search is employed here for the illustrative purpose  fast search methods  such as binary search  may be employed to improve efficiency  the simplex method  16  is used for minimizing the error objective function `` to determine the coordinates of the target tag j  xj ; yj ; zj  3.3 active schemes in contrast to the passive scheme described above for determining the rfid tag location  an active scheme is for locating a reader  with reference to a set of preinstalled passive rfid tags under a predetermined arbitrary coordinate system  we have pursued an active scheme  namely the deb  deb follows an iteration process to build a spherical model  which is the best fit of imperfect responses of the reference tags  such that the sphere center accurately indicates the target position  deb is found to pinpoint a reader in the hexahedron with high accuracy  it also permits the flexible placement of reference tags  moreover  it is raf  avoiding the need of distance estimation according to received wireless signal strength or phase difference at the reader  therefore  its accuracy is not materially affected by the types of readers possibly with different radiation patterns  it does not require multiple power levels  thus dodging tedious power calibration  the coordinate calculation is fast  and the system installation cost is low  3.3.1 localization system description the localization system  at which our proposed scheme aims  is illustrated in fig  2 a set of reference tags with known coordinates are placed on two1 or more planes  for example  on the ceiling and the floor of the hexahedron  plus the walls to improve accuracy   the placement of reference tags can be flexible in deb  not limited to horizontal planes but virtually anywhere inside the space  allowing more practical deployment  especially in buildings with metal frames  which seriously hinder signal propagation for rfid gear  while both passive and active rfid tags may be deployed as reference tags  passive ones are chosen due to their lower costs  except for a large hexahedron  where active tags are indispensible for required long backscatter transmissions   similar to the passive scheme  an arbitrary local coordinate system is assumed  as shown in fig  2 the reference tags are placed at known spots  with their coordinates stored either inside the tags themselves or in a database maintained by a local server  the reader is located within the hexahedron and has a fixed and suitable transmission power to activate some of those reference tags  in addition  backscatter responses emitted from activated maneesilp et al   rfid support for accurate 3d localization fig  3 top view of reference tags under deb  with activated  or nonactivated  tags marked by 1  or 1  and the solid rectangular marking hexahedron space  tags are reachable to the reader  as stated earlier  our scheme does not rely on the signal strength-based radio range estimation  thus  it requires neither to fine-tune the transmission power nor to estimate the distance according to the received backscatter signal strength  which could result in considerable inaccuracy  3.3.2 overview of deb deb determines directly the spherical model  which is the best fit of all activated reference tags in 3d  its basic idea is to construct an appropriate sphere that partitions the reference tags into two classes  activated tags inside the sphere and nonactivated ones outside the sphere  if an active  or nonactivated  tag falls outside  inside  the sphere centered at the reader location  the tag is misclassified  because it negatively guides reader location estimation  in a nutshell  deb minimizes the total number of misclassified tags by iterative refinement in the 3d space  during an iteration  the coordinates and the radius of the sphere are rectified progressively  the refinement process repeats until the misclassification degree is below a preset threshold  yielding the estimated x  y  and z coordinates of the reader  unlike earlier nem  which involves separate passes for computing the x and y coordinates on each 2d plane and for computing the z coordinate  with fewer reference tags involved during each 2d optimization phase  23    deb follows one single pass to compute all x  y  and z coordinates at the same time for higher accuracy  as will be demonstrated in section 4 additionally  as the reference tags are not read reliably  nem calls for preprocessing tag responses so as to fill in holes  i.e  the nonactivated tags surrounded by activated tags  possibly due to false negative responses  before coordinate calculation starts  23   by contrast  deb requires no fill-in preprocess and is more flexible in reference tag deployment  allowing the reference tags to be placed over arbitrary planes  as opposed to only the ceiling and the floor planes under nem   3.3.3 coordinates calculation the top view of reference tags and the sphere are illustrated in fig  3 the solid rectangle indicates the area of reference tags inside the hexahedron  the solid circle is the top view of a sphere that models the rfid reader coverage area  the entire space is divided into grid cells  the label inside a cell indicates its status  see fig  3   while the area outside the hexahedron is filled with empty cells including no reference tags  the cells with  or without  activated reference tags are marked as 1  or 1   deb follows an iterative process to lower the total distances from all 1451 fig  4 the histograms of reference tags along the x-axis and the y -axis  respectively  misclassified reference tags to the current sphere surface progressively  this process can be done by considering the distances between the misclassified reference tags outside and inside the sphere  i.e  false positive reference tags and false negative reference tags  the former are activated reference tags outside the modeled sphere and have the positive distance values  whereas the latter are those nonactivated ones inside the modeled sphere and have the negative distance values  see fig  5   deb aims to minimize the distance difference due to these two types of misclassified tags  deb starts with the initial values of x  y  z  and radius r  which are all obtained from the histogram of activated reference tags in each axis  as shown in fig  4  the histograms dictate the initial values of x  y  and z according to pnpx x pnpy y pnpz z f i i1 fi  i i1 fi  i xinit ; yinit ; zinit i1 i ; nat nat nat 3 where npx  npy  and npz are the numbers of grid positions on the x-axis  the y -axis  and the z-axis  respectively  while fix  or fiy or fiz  is the number of activated reference tags from all planes at the i position on the x  or y or z  axis and nat is the total number of activated reference tags inside the hexahedron  for example  the initial coordinates of  x  y  in fig  4 are  4.49  3.18   the initial z value can be derived in a similar way  in fig  2  if there are 10  or 20  activated reference tags on the lower plane  i.e  z 0  or the upper plane  i.e  z h   the initial z value is then given by  10x0 20h=10 20 0:67h  note that while initial values of x  y  and z can be obtained by different expressions  those derived following  3  will guarantee convergence quickly  the initial value of r is derived by the following equation  x  max  xmin ymax  ymin zmax  zmin rinit max ; ; ; 4 2 2 2 where xmax  or xmin  is the maximum  or minimum  x value among all activated tags  and ymax  ymin  zmax  and zmin are defined similarly  the initial derived values are usually inaccurate due to those challenges outlined in section 3.1  calling for an iterative procedure to refine them progressively  refinement is guided by misclassified reference tags with respect to the current sphere  in fig 5a  the two big circles  with z equal to 0 and 17  depict the intersection of the current sphere  before any refinement  with the floor and the ceiling  respectively  there exist misclassified tags  for example  the small filled circles indicate activated tags 1452 ieee transactions on computers  fig  5 refinement in deb  with  a  a 3d view of current sphere and misclassified tags  and  b  an involved refinement  outside the current sphere  i.e  false positive tags  and solid vectors c and e denote their distance to the current sphere center and depicted as positive vectors in fig  5b  respectively  the small unfilled circles inside the sphere are nonactivated  i.e  false negative tags  and their negative distances to the current sphere center are represented by dashed vectors d and f and depicted as negative vectors in fig  5b  respectively  let s denote a 3d sphere  characterized by its center sc xs ; ys ; zs and its associated radius sr  the sphere in iteration j  s j is determined

zs  is the x  or y  or z  coordinate of sphere center sc in iteration  j  1   the essence behind  6  is as follows  if the distance from a misclassified tag  ti  to scj1 is larger than srj1  ti is a false positive tag that should be included in the sphere  requiring that the refined sphere center scj be moved toward ti  and srj1 be enlarged to include the tag  in contrast  if the distance is smaller  ti is false negative one  signifying that scj should be moved away from the tag  with srj1 shrunk to exclude the tag  accordingly  ij1 in  5  serves as the weight due to ti  which has a bigger impact on rectification if j1  srj1 j is larger  c is the aggregated impact of all jlj1 i misclassified tags  for example  those denoted by c  d  e  and f in fig  5a and c  -d  e  and -f

false positive  or negative  tag enlarges  or reduces  the sphere radius  for all misclassified tags in nfj1  the refinement process for s j repeats until it converges  i.e  when jnfj j is smaller than a predetermined threshold   this is found to be swift  typically taking only a few iterations  as will be shown in section 5  3.4 accuracy improvement for deb the accuracy of deb depends on two factors  first  it is affected by the density of reference tags  low density tends to result in coarse granularity and high errors  to achieve high accuracy  a large number of reference tags should be deployed  the state-of-the-art rfid technology can effectively deal with the collision problem under very high tag density  in general  more reference tags yield better accuracy  naturally with a higher cost at the same time  second  as stated in section 3.1  signal propagation from the rfid reader does not form a sphere  due to varying signal attenuation amounts and different antenna gains in different directions  to study this problem quantitatively  we define a parameter  dubbed degree of irregularity  doi   given an upper bound  ru  and a lower bound  rl  of the readers signal transmission range  doi signifies the maximum variation of the readers transmission range per unit degree change  for example  fig  6a shows the transmission range of a reader with doi 0:03  in two dimensions   the inner circle is the lower bound  while the outer circle is the upper bound of the interrogation range  the irregular curve between them illustrates the actual transmission range of the reader over 360 degree  clearly  doi has a negative impact on accuracy  a larger doi results in a more deformed circle specified by the activated reference tags  and accordingly lower accuracy  while it is difficult to perfectly compensate the irregular antenna gains and path losses in different directions  a low-cost antenna array with multiple radiation elements may be employed to minimize the effect of doi   note that maneesilp et al   rfid support for accurate 3d localization a current rfid reader may support multiple antennas ; for example  each alien technologys alr-9900 reader employed in our testbed has four antenna connectors  2    the calculation of coordinates is based on all reference tags activated by the antenna array  figs  6b  6c  6d  6e  and 6f show the superimposed transmission range of an antenna array with 2  4  8  16  and 32 radiation elements  respectively  where ru 1:2 units  rl 0:8 unit  and doi 0:03 clearly  more radiation elements result in a set of activated tags closer to a perfect circle and accordingly more accurate results  at the expense of an increased hardware cost  we also employ an optimized method  with calculation based only on the set of nodes which are activated by all radiation elements  to more effectively filter out irregularity  our simulation results of the aforementioned approach for accuracy improvement are provided in the next section  particular challenges arise when the reader moves near a wall or a corner of a hexahedron-shaped space  due not only to abundant interrogated signals being reflected from the walls  but also to the absence of tags outside the space  as a result  those situations yield severely distorted shapes of activated reference tags  considerably hampering the accuracy of reader localization based on only those activated tags alone  to this end  an enhancement method has been developed for improving location estimation  aiming to account for those missing tags which otherwise are present if they were placed outside the room when the walls were nonexisting  known as the enhanced deb  edeb   compensated tags are virtual ones employed for helping define a less deformed sphere to arrive at better localization  the compensated tags together with those activated tags inside the room are used for computing the target location  edeb is also applicable to situations where large objects  e.g  metal shelves  exist to block signals from the rfid reader to certain reference tags  the way to obtain those virtual  i.e  compensated  tags starts with estimating the center position of activated tags on a given plane  be the floor or the ceiling  using deb following  3    7   denoted by  xc ; yc   the estimated center  xc ; yc  then serves as the reference origin of a cartesian coordinate system  called cc  whose x0 -axis and y 0 -axis are in parallel  respectively  to the original x-axis and y -axis of the plane  as shown in fig  7 clearly  cc separates activated tags into four quadrants  assuming that xc 6 0 and yc 6 0 for example  each activated tag at  xi ; yi  in the fourth quadrant  e.g  a  b  or c   a virtual tag is obtained at location  xv ; yv  in the second quadrant  e.g  a0  b0  or c0   satisfying xv xi cos  yi sin yv xi sin  yi cos  8 according to  8   virtual tags  xv ; yv  outside the room are derived from activated tags  xi ; yi  in each quadrant by rotating  to aid in pinpointing the target  as discuss earlier  the target reader is located at the point marked by a star  $   those virtual tags derived using  8  are denoted by the solid square   in fig  7  where the new  xc ; yc   denoted by the triangle   is seen to be closer to the center of the set of activated tags plus virtual tags than that of the set of activated tags alone  note that edeb is applicable for 1453 fig  7 the compensation process  improving localization accuracy  provided that the target object is not located on a side wall  or at a corner   when the target is moved away from any wall  toward the room center   fewer virtual tags result  as the set of activated tags then define a better circle  calling for fewer compensated tags  in practice  the compensation process is invoked only if the target is close to a side wall  a situation which can be easily identified by examining the number of activated tags in the row  or column  just next to a wall ; it is closer to the wall if the number is larger  and the compensation process is invoked when the number exceeds a threshold  say 2 given the compensation process aims to rectify the set of tags involved in a target localization  the process may repeat after a refined center  x1c  y1c  is obtained  by viewing the new center as  xc  yc  and following  3    8  to get a new center  x2c  y2c  in the second rectification  this compensation process finishes when the distance between  xic  yic  in the ith iteration and  xci1  yi1 c  is smaller than a predetermined threshold  it is found that this refinement usually completes after a few iterations  say  3 or less   in essence  edeb relies on two accuracy improvement techniques  1  reader rotation  to emulate an antenna array with k radiation elements  by rotating 360 degree/k in each step  to deal with doi and 2  tag compensation to deal with wall adversary  experimental results of edeb will be demonstrated in section 5.2  4 simulation results we carry out extensive simulations by using matlab  12  and java codes to evaluate our proposed 3d rfid positioning schemes  in particular  we study the impact of several parameters of interest  such as the radio propagation irregularity  the number of radiation elements of the antenna array  and the reference node density  which may dictate the accuracy of our passive and active schemes  we have simulated a hexahedron of the size of a typical container  about 400  80  80   4.1 passive scheme as we have discussed in section 3.2  a set of reference tags and readers need to be deployed on the floor or the ceiling of the hexahedron for the passive scheme  in our simulation  n 12 readers are deployed by default  the density of 1454 ieee transactions on computers  vol  62  no  7  july 2013 fig  8 simulation results under the passive scheme  the reference tags is represented by a parameter   which is the distance between two adjacent reference tags  with  equal to 1 ft by default  each reader has k transmission power levels with a maximum transmission range of 16 feet  we assume the transmission power levels are calibrated so that there is a linearly increasing response range with the increase of power level  to improve the accuracy  in other words  the transmission range per power level is 16/k feet  we vary the values of n    and k to observe their impacts on the accuracy of the passive scheme  the error is defined as the absolute difference between the actual coordinates of  x  y  z  and the calculated coordinates of target objects   xc ; yc ; zc   as expressed by q error x  xc 2 y  yc 2 z  zc 2  the results are the average of 2,560 sample points distributed uniformly in the hexahedron  we have observed from our simulation that there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and the cost in the implementation of the passive scheme  we first study the impact of the number of reference readers  n   as can be seen in fig  8a  the errors decrease with more readers deployed  because more readers result in a more accurate error objective function  i.e  with more terms in  1    at the same time  however  deploying more readers clearly increases the system cost and leads to a higher computing complexity and longer time to locate the target  besides the number of readers  the number of power levels  k  available to each reader is usually a dominating factor on the accuracy of the passive scheme  our results show that more accurate coordinates are yielded with more power levels  see fig  8b  with k up to 16   this is reasonable  because a larger k results in a finer increase in the readers transmission power and  thus  more accurate estimation of distances from the target tag to the readers  however  the reader with many power levels is usually unavailable off-shelf or prohibitively expensive  figs  8c and 8d show the impact of target locations on the accuracy of the passive scheme  it is observed that the accuracy of x and y is insensitive to the location of the target  the errors vary only marginally with the location  at the same time  the error of z is not affected much by the location when the target is below 5 feet  while the target becomes very close to the ceiling  the error of z increases significantly because the relative error becomes high  in addition  we observe that the density of reference tags has less impact on accuracy compared with n and k  see fig  8e   this is because the density of the reference tags is often sufficiently high  leading to a much finer granularity  compared with the readers transmission power levels  in particular   does not noticeably affect accuracy when   16=k  because  with the reference tag density so high  the power level granularity completely dominates the errors  4.2 active scheme to employ the proposed localization scheme  a set of reference tags are placed at known coordinates on the floor and the ceiling of the hexahedron  similar to the simulations for the passive scheme  the density of the reference tags is represented by   which equals 1 foot  the target rfid reader is located inside the hexahedron and has a fixed transmission power  which results in ru 7:2 ft and rl 4:8 ft  i.e  the upper and the lower bounds of readers transmission range   the default value of doi is 0.03 the results are based on an antenna with four  4  radiation elements  unless specified otherwise  to characterize deb accuracy  we compare the simulation results of deb with those of nem in all three different approaches for selecting reference tags  scm  ibm  and fbm  23   in addition  the optimized scheme discussed in maneesilp et al   rfid support for accurate 3d localization 1455 fig  9 simulation results under deb and nem active schemes  section 3.4 was incorporated to effectively utilize all radiation elements for compensating doi  on top of deb and of nem with the fbm  we vary   doi  and the number of elements k to observe their impacts on the accuracy under deb and under nem  the impact of doi on accuracy for  1:0 ft is depicted in fig  9a  where the errors are seen to increase monotonically with doi  because higher doi results in a more deformed sphere  under deb  or circle  under nem  of the activated reference tags and accordingly larger errors in finding the target coordinates  nem  with optimized fbm  is more accurate than other nem methods  able to locate the target with errors less than 0.5 ft even when doi is high  nem  with scm   on the other hand  results in the largest error  because it is heavily affected by the partial circles when the target is near a hexahedron side or corner  as expected  deb  which is optimized  i.e  its calculation is based only on the set of nodes that are activated by all k radiation elements  achieves the best accuracy and is robust to the increase of doi  because it handles all misclassified reference tags by 3d optimization effectively  employing more radiation elements can effectively reduce the negative impact of doi  as illustrated in fig  9b  where the results of deb and nem  with optimized fbm  under various numbers of radiation elements are shown  the errors are the largest under one antenna  i.e  k 1   and they are reduced sharply when the antenna array deployed has two and four radiation elements  more radiation elements yield smaller errors  because those activated tags better construct a sphere  thereby yielding more accurate target coordinates  deb outperforms nem consistantly for any given k the density of the reference tags    also affects achievable accuracy  as also demonstrated in fig  9c  a higher density  i.e  smaller   tends to result in smaller errors  when  becomes  1 ft  however  it has an insignificant impact on the accuracy of any scheme  this is because  for   1 ft  the density of reference tags is no longer a dominating factor  as the errors are then introduced mainly by doi  clearly  deb outperforms nem for any   achieving an error of some 0.2 ft only for  1:0 ft  in comparison to more than 0.3 ft under the best nem  i.e  nem  with optimized fbm   in addition  the gap widens as  grows  the execution times  in ms  of location identification schemes versus the number of involved reference tags  n  are depicted in fig  9d  where the density of the reference tags    is fixed at 1.0 ft and n includes all activated tags plus all nonactivated tags located within the reader antenna range  when the number of involved tags  n  rises  the execution time grows accordingly for every identification scheme  as expected  the proposed deb scheme enjoys the time complexity of o  n  in the presence of n involved tags  exhibiting far smaller execution times when compared with the earlier nem counterpart  which requires two rounds of 2d optimization on the ceiling and the floor planes separately  followed by z coordinate calculation  23    given n 1 ; 600  for example  deb run on a laptop takes only 83 ms  in contrast to some 400 ms  ignoring the time for preprocessing activated tags  under nem  as illustrated in fig  9d  it should be noted that the number of involved reference tags  n  depends solely on the reader antenna range and the tag density     irrespective of the total number of tags deployed or the hexahedron size  the 1456 ieee transactions on computers  proposed deb smartly outperforms nem in both identification accuracy and speed  suitable for real-time applications  figs  9e and 9f show the errors of deb at various locations in the hexahedron  the highest accuracy is observed when the target is at the center of the hexahedron  i.e  x 20 and y 4 for z 4  where the coordinate error approaches 0.2 ft when the target rfid reader moves closer to a hexahedron corner  the errors grow monotonically because the circles or spheres formed by those activated reference tags suffer from more distortion  this calls for an enhancement method to deal with those situations with pronounced localization inaccuracy  and such a method will be detailed in the next section  in addition to its fast localization and high accuracy  the proposed deb scheme is readily applicable in practice because it employs only passive tags  whose price may soon drop to several cents apiece  currently  the passive tags adopted for our experimental study  i.e  the alien squiggle tags  cost less than 15/each  for a roll of 10,000 at $ 1,488.00   the deb identification time for a huge room  say  sized 99 ft by 49 ft by h  where h is the reader antenna range  with 10,000 deployed tags remains no more than 83 ms as long as n  1 ; 600  see fig  9d   consequently  a deb-based rfid positioning system can be established with a fairly low cost while achieving high reader localization of any place inside a 3d hexahedron  5 experimental evaluation 5.1 experimental setup to further investigate the effectiveness of our proposed 3d positioning schemes  we have conducted experiments by using the alien rfid kits  1    2   including an alr-9900 rfid reader and aln-9540 squiggle tags  our experiments were done in the realistic environment of 16 ft long  14 ft wide  and 17 ft high  the alr-9900 reader connects via the tcp/ip port  on which basic web-based utility software is run to control the reader  e.g  to find a suitable transmission power level  and the java program is run to obtain the results  e.g  to acquire the id of responding tags   needed for our 3d positioning schemes  a circularly polarized antenna is attached to the reader  which supports up to four antennas  a photo of our experimental setup is shown in fig  10  where the white box is a readers antenna attached to the red box  which is an rfid reader  the reference tags are the small rectangles placed on the middle of each square ceiling board  we carried out experiments using aln-9540 tags and alr-9900 reader attached with an antenna  as mention earlier  given that the readers antenna has coverage area far beyond the room under its regular transmission power  our experiments lowered the antennas transmission power to -15 dbm so as to ensure that some parts of the sphere surface are located inside the target room  without loss of generality  an arbitrary coordinate system is assumed  with its origin at the readers antenna in each experimental setup  the reference tags are put at grid points across the ceiling and on the floor  with the distance between two adjacent grid points equal to 1 ft  as depicted in fig  11 in the figure  an activated tag is denoted by a small circle with a solid center  and those on the floor are easier to be visualized  than those on the ceiling   with vol  62  no  7  july 2013 fig  10 the experimental setup in the real environment  the actual reader position denoted by a star and the calculated reader locations according to deb and nem schemes marked under each situation  as described in section 3.4  the reader antenna suffers from doi  which can be mitigated using the antenna array  without a suitable antenna array at hand  we emulated the effect of an antenna array  with k radiation elements  via rotating the reader antenna k times each by  360/k  degree during every experiment to suppress doi  a larger k tends to yields a better shaped sphere those activated tags  thus higher accuracy in locating the target object  5.2 experimental results and discussion six sets of experimental data are presented in fig  11 for evaluating the accuracy of deb and nem  under various target positions and different k values  more specifically  we have carried out experiments when the target reader antenna is situated at the center  with x 8:5  y 7:5  z 8:5   close to a sidewall  with x 8:5  y 4:0  z 8:5  and to a corner  with x 4:0  y 10:0  z 8:5  of the room  we vary k to be 1 and 4 when k 4  the readers antenna was rotated by 90 degree for four times  and those activated tags with respect to each antenna orientation were aggregated together for computing the reader location  this process can also be done in one step without rotation by using four antenna arrays as discuss in section 3.4 to collect the tag information at once  in fig  11  the target reader is located at the point marked by a star  $   whereas the calculated positions under deb  or nem  is denoted by   or   if the target reader is moved toward a corner or a sidewall of the room  computed coordinates exhibit higher errors due mainly to fewer tags being activated because no tags are outside the room  and also to rising interferences caused by heavier reflection from the walls  as stated earlier and confirmed in figs  11c  11d  11e  and 11f  to deal with this wall adversary  edeb was introduced in section 3.4 maneesilp et al   rfid support for accurate 3d localization 1457 fig  11 the experimental results  with actual reader position indicated by the star  $  the diamond    or the cross   denotes the position estimated by deb  or nem  and the square u t denotes the result under edeb calculation with the accuracy enhancement process applied  to enhance the accuracy through a compensation process which accounts for those missing tags outside the room  experimental results under edeb are also illustrated in fig  11  as marked by u t when the reader is situated in the room center with k 1  deb scheme works to locate the target accurately  as illustrated in fig  11a  exhibiting an error of 0.76 ft  which is better than 0.98 ft under nem   utilizing the accumulated tag responses after k 4 rotations  each by 90 degree   both deb and nem improve coordinate accuracy  as shown in fig 11b  specifically  the error then stands at 0.07 ft under deb to enjoy 91 percent improvement over k 1  whereas the error drops to 0.47 ft under nem  in this case  deb is far more accurate than its nem counterpart  1458 fig  12 rd  i.e  a shown in fig  5b in ft  from  5  versus number of iterations under deb  when the reader is moved toward a side of the room  the accuracy of deb deteriorates  as demonstrated in figs  11c and 11d  in addition  the benefit from an antenna array  of k 4  drops  with the calculated errors equal to 0.45 ft under k 4 on the other hand  edeb brings down the error to roughly 0.3 ft for both k 1 and k 4  as denoted by u t apparently  tag compensation is more effective in accuracy improvement in this situation  as expected  because it is aimed to handle wall adversary  the localization errors rise noticeably when the reader is moved toward a corner of the room  as depicted in figs  11e and 11f  with the errors approaching 2.2 ft to 2.7 ft even for k 4 under both deb and nem  these large errors are due to severe wall advisory  which has to be dealt with using tag compensation  indeed  edeb boosts localization accuracy significantly  giving rise to errors below 0.4 ft  representing accuracy improvement more than 80 percent  under both k 1 and k 4  as demonstrated in figs  11e and 11f  given error amounts are comparable under k 1 and k 4  reader rotation offers limited alleviation for wall advisory  and tag compensation is indispensable  the tag compensation process repeats to arrive at more accurate target coordinates progressively  progressive iterations are found to lower refined distance  rd  monotonically  as depicted in fig  12  where rd refers to as the sum of the distance between each misclassified tag and the surface of the defined sphere calculated from  5   misclassified tags fall into two categories  the false positive and false negative activated tags  with the former  or the latter  ones yielding positive  or negative  distance values in calculating rd  according to the curves in fig  12  the rds  or a shown in fig  5b under deb  decrease quickly  and they drop to negligible amounts in a few iterations  for all of our experimental scenarios considered  the computation times taken by this compensation process are small  involving some 20 ms  or 40 ms  only if the target is at the center  or near a wall   when executed on a dell optiplex gx745 desktop machine with core2 cpu @ 2.40 ghz and 3 gb of memory  localization error versus the number of iterations under edeb is illustrated in fig  13 four scenarios are included in the figure  including the target located close to a wall and to a corner with k 1 and k 4 tag compensation lowers the computed errors effectively  greatly enhancing localization accuracy  under the worst scenario considered  for the ieee transactions on computers  vol  62  no  7  july 2013 fig  13 localization error  in ft  versus number of iterations under edeb  target near a corner with k 1   tag compensation is shown to bring the error down to about 0.4 ft in eight iterations  resulting in accuracy improvement of some 86 percent  6 conclusion we have considered and contrasted two rfid-based 3d localization schemes  namely  the passive scheme and the active scheme aiming to locate a target object in 3d space  both schemes are raf  i.e  distance estimation based on signal strength is not require   thus exhibiting accuracy levels independent of reader types  with varying radiation patterns   in the passive scheme  we locate an rfid tag  which is attached to the target object using rfid tags and readers as the reference points  under the active scheme  we propose the deb scheme for inexpensively and quickly locating either a mobile person or robot who wears an rfid reader or an object approached by an rfid reader in a 3d space  deemed the very first raf 3d localization without involving other devices or sensors in support of high accuracy  the active scheme employs a set of rfid tags with known locations as references to pinpoint a reader operating in one fixed power level as the target object  we have carried out analyses  extensive simulations  and testbed experiments to evaluate the proposed schemes under various system parameters  including the doi  the number of radiation elements of the antenna array  and the reference tag density  our results show that both schemes are effective  with active schemes outperform the passive one  they also demonstrate that the proposed active scheme  deb  clearly prevails over its earlier counterpart  i.e  nem  23   in both identification accuracy and speed  suitable for real-time applications  furthermore  edeb is developed for accuracy improvement  often locating an rfid reader dramatically better  in particular when it is close to a side or corner of a 3d hexahedron  acknowledgments this work was supported in part by the
