italy  m.ruta  t.dinoia  disciascio  f.scioscia  e.tinelli  @ poliba.it abstract  this paper presents an extended framework supported by a suitable dissemination protocol to enable ubiquitous knowledge bases  u-kbs  in pervasive rfid environments  a u-kb is a distributed and decentralized knowledge base where the factual knowledge  i.e  individuals  is scattered among objects disseminated within the environment  with no centralized repository and coordination  key words  rfid  802.11  pervasive computing  semantic web  resource discovery 1 introduction in pervasive contexts intelligence is embedded into a physical environment by means of a relatively large number of heterogeneous micro devices such as rfid tags and wireless sensors  each conveying a small amount of useful information  due to power and cost constraints  they are usually endowed with very low storage space  little or no processing capability and short-range  low-throughput wireless links  each mobile host in the area can access information only on micro devices in its communication range  consequently  approaches based on centralized control and information storage are utterly impractical in such scenarios  in our previous work  1   we devised solutions for the integration of semanticenhanced epcglobal rfid into mobile ad-hoc networks  manets   nevertheless  we were still forced to use a fixed central component for reasoning over a knowledge base  kb   this led to expensive information duplication within the environment  semantic annotations were placed simultaneously on tags and within the kb ; moreover  the reasoning engine was a single point of failure  here we want to show how these problems can be mitigated if a more distributed approach is followed  we present a general framework to carry out an advanced matchmaking using metadata stored in rfids lacking unique and fixed knowledge bases  an advanced resource discovery is supported by a dissemination protocol allowing to exactly locate suitable descriptions directly on tags attached to objects  the proposed framework comprises the specification of components and operations of a u-kb  ubiquitous knowledge base   as well as a distributed application-layer protocol for dissemination and discovery of knowledge embedded within rfid tags in a manet-based computing environment  rfid readers are adopted as cluster-heads w.r.t  tags in their radio range and they are able to automatically build up a multi-hop communication infrastructure when placed in the same area  2   for lower network layers we adopt ieee 802.11  3   ip and udp  while for knowledge representation we exploit dl-based ontology languages originally conceived for the semantic web effort  particularly dig  4   which is a more compact equivalent of owl-dl1  the remaining of the paper is organized as follows  in the next section we present motivation of our paper ; in section 3 some significant theoretical aspects of the proposed approach are revised ; in section 4 we outline the proposed data propagation and retrieval framework  whereas in section 5 our proposal is explained and motivated by means of a case study  section 6 closes the paper  2 motivation motivation for this paper stems from our experience in using knowledge representation  kr  approaches based on description logics  dls  in pervasive contexts  and particularly in semantic-based discovery frameworks for objects equipped with rfid tags  1   in traditional applications  see  5  1.5  for a survey  a knowledge representation system  krs  plays an architectural role very much like a database management system  dbms   both are used as central repositories where knowledge of the problem domain can be inserted  forming a kb  and upon which automated inference procedures can be executed in order to extract implicit knowledge  hence  in traditional krss  a kb is seen as a single large entity which is immediately available  either in local storage or via a high-throughput network link  this approach is effective only as long as large computing resources and a stable network infrastructure are granted  a different approach is needed to adapt kr tools and technologies to functional and non-functional requirements of mobile and ubiquitous computing applications  they are characterized by user  and device  mobility  dependency on context  severe resource limitations  hence  knowledge-based systems designed for wired networks are hardly adaptable  due to architectural differences and performance issues  as figure 1 shows  in our vision a u-kb layer provides access to knowledge embedded into semantic-enhanced epcglobal rfid tags populating a smart environment  discovery and reasoning tasks can then be performed either by hosts in the local manet or by a remote entity through a gateway exposing a high-level interface  e.g  web sevices of rpc  remote procedure call  or rest  representational state transfer  type  and translating remote methods into operations on the u-kb  this paper focuses on the definition of the components of a u-kb layer  while parallel research effort is being spent into the adaptation of reasoning procedures to resource-constrained mobile devices  1 owl web ontology language  w3c recommendation  february 10th 2004  available at http  //www.w3.org/tr/owlfeatures/ fig  1 architecture of the proposed approach 2.1 application scenarios all application areas of rfid technology  6  can be enhanced by a semantically rich description and discovery layer  without depending on a centralized infrastructure  in the lifecycle of industrial products  manufacturing and quality control can exploit accurate descriptions of raw materials  components and processes  sale depots benefit from easier inventory management and can introduce ubiquitous commerce  7  capabilities like in  8   withouth expensive investments in infrastructure  finally  smart post-sale services can be provided to purchasers  by integrating knowledge discovery in home and office appliances  1   asset management is greatly improved in those scenarios where retrieval should depend on object properties and purposes  rather than mere identification codes  in healthcare applications  equipment  drugs and patients can be thoroughly and formally described and tracked  enabling to provide not only monitoring but also decision support to clinicians  wireless pervasive technologies help break barriers between patient management in the hospital and at home  likewise  in museums and archaeological sites  smart semantic-based content fruition can be granted to local visitors as well as to remote clients connected through the internet  leveraging the lightweight infrastructure already deployed for internal inventory  the u-kb approach can be extended to other monitoring and sensing technologies beyond rfid  wireless semantic sensor networks  9  are an emerging yet challenging technology  semantic-based sensory data dissemination and query processing are needed to enable advanced solutions for e.g  precision agriculture and disaster recovery  3 3.1 from kbs to u-kbs kb components and operations a dl knowledge base has two components  5   a tbox  containing intensional knowledge in the form of an ontology describing general concepts and properties of the reference domain ; an abox containing extensional knowledge that is specific to the individuals of a particular problem within the domain  current krss are characterized in terms of what functions they provide to applications  instead of exposing system data structures and low-level operations  10   two basic functions were identified for kb management   1  tell  build the tbox and the abox by explicit assertions of terminological knowledge and information about individuals   2  ask  extracting  implicit  knowledge by using inference procedures that determine if the meaning of the query is implied by the information that has been told to the system  this paradigm has led to detailed and formal interface specifications for knowledge representation systems  such as krss  11  and  more recently  dig  4    implemented by most krss  the ability to remove information from a kb is also desirable  due to technical reasons  most systems allow to un-tell  i.e  retract  only information that has been previously told explicitly  12   nevertheless  experience has shown that  for the vast majority of applications  in production environments the tbox seldom or never changes after an initial knowledge acquisition phase  see  5  ch  8  for a review   3.2 u-kb components in our approach we preserve the distinction between tbox and abox  the tbox is contained in an ontology file  which can be managed by one or more mobile hosts  we hypothesize that ontologies are defined before object annotation and u-kb deployment and do not change during normal system activity  we adopt ontology universally unique identifiers  ouuids   13  to mark ontologies unambiguously and to associate each individual to the ontology w.r.t  it is described  the abox is scattered within a smart environment  as kb individuals are physically tied to micro devices deployed in the field  in rfid-based scenarios  each individual is a semantically annotated object/product description  stored within the rfid transponder the object is clung to  each annotation refers to an ontology providing the intensional knowledge for a particular domain  in detail  each individual is characterized by  globally unique item identifier  the epc code in the case of rfid tags  ; ouuid ; semantic annotation  stored as a compressed document fragment in the dl-based language dig ; a set of data-oriented attributes  which allow to integrate and extend logic-based reasoning services with application-specific and context-aware information processing  since several object categories can co-exist within the same physical space  multiple u-kbs can actually populate the same environment and share the system infrastructure  3.3 u-kb operations in our u-kb approach  we adhere to the classic tell/ask model  these functions  however  are implemented in a novel way  coping with the characteristics of pervasive computing scenarios  section 4 defines in detail the data structures and protocol devised to build a u-kb system  tell/un-tell operations are transparent to users  i.e  no explicit knowledge declaration/retraction is required  the system allows autonomic creation and maintenance of a virtual knowledge base  by means of a data alignment protocol between caches of the various mobile hosts  each host advertises individuals it sees in its proximity via rfid  other hosts store advertisements in their cache and forward them to nearby nodes  the protocol keeps track of the freshness of advertised individuals through sequence numbers  so that only updates will be automatically propagated  each individual has also a limited time-to-live  ttl   so that it will be automatically removed  un-told  from the u-kb if not renewed  the system tends toward a steady state where every host is aware of all individuals in the environment  ask operations require a preliminary retrieval phase  the requester host specifies the ontology identifier and a range for each particular attribute it is interested in  access to local cache tables provides ip addresses of hosts owning all the individuals that meet the specified criteria  pre-filtered on-demand provisioning of kb individuals avoids unnecessary data transfers  minimizes transmissions for data alignment and prevents propagation issues in the case of description update or individual removal  the requester can fetch ontology file and filtered individuals from their respective providers  so as to reconstruct a local subset of the whole kb  containing only the tbox and individuals which are actually needed  then it is able to submit any ask-type request to a local or remote reasoning engine  in the present work we aim at assuring on-demand knowledge availability  so we will not specify further how reasoning is carried out  4 how to build a u-kb the proposed framework presents a two level infrastructure where rfid is exploited at the field layer  able to interconnect tags dipped in the environment and readers able to receive the transmitted data  whereas the discovery layer is related to the inter-reader ad-hoc communication  see figure 2   the communication between the tag field and readers exploits the semantic-enhanced epcglobal rfid protocol data exchange  1   whereas the data propagation among readers is performed following a data dissemination paradigm in 802.11  3  proposed here  thus  the resource discovery is based on three stages   1  the extraction of goods parameters  for carrying object characteristics from field layer to discovery one  ;  2  resource data dissemination  to make the overall nodes fully aware of the network content  ;  3  the extraction of resource annotations  for carrying semantic-based descriptions from field level to the discovery one  for the further matchmaking  each reader involved in the data propagation and/or in the object discovery  maintains a cache containing the advertisements which will be matched against requests  it plays a central role in the whole service oriented architecture as it advertises contextual parameters referred to tags in its radio range  at the field layer  and during the further phase  at the discovery layer   it will receive requests from nearby nodes  via 802.11  and in case it will extract semantic annotations from tags in range  via rfid epcglobal  so replying to the requester  discovery layer 802.11 rfid reader/wi-fi pda rfid reader/wi-fi pda rfid tag tag field layer rfid epcglobal rfid tag rfid tag field layer rfid epcglobal fig  2 field and discovery layers in the proposed framework architecture we hypothesize each resource in the manet is labeled by means of the triple  source address  ouuid  epc   where the first value is the ip address of the rfid reader which has seen the resource  the second one marks the specific reference ontology the resource is associated with  the last one is the electronic product code  initially  each reader will advertise  for each resource  the managed reference ouuid as well as some context-aware parameter  i.e  the resource life time   so the initial selection allows to choose only semantically compatible services  ouuid matching  which have suitable values for context aware parameters  to perform the data dissemination  resource providers peri fig  3 tag data dissemination phase odically send advertisement packets also specifying the maximum number of hops for the advertisement travel  max adv diameter   the cyclic advertisement diffusion allows to cope with tag and reader mobility  during their travel  the advertisements are forwarded using mac broadcasts and can be stored in the cache fig  4 retrieval of advertised semantic annotations from tags memories of the nodes they go through  when starting a resource matchmaking  a node generally attempts to cover the request by using resource descriptions stored within its own cache memory  if some semantically annotated description is missing  it can be retrieved in unicast using apposite demand pdus  on the contrary  if a requester has no resource descriptions in its cache or if managed resources are considered insufficient to satisfy the request  the node can send a solicit pdu with a specified maximum travel diameter  max req diameter  in order to get new resource locators  a node receiving a solicit  replies  in unicast  providing cache table entries matching parameters contained within the solicit frame  if it does not manage any information satisfying the solicit  it will reply with a no matches message  during their travel  replies to the demand and solicit pdus are used to update the cache memory of forwarding nodes  figure 3 and figure 4 show the typical sequence and involved actors of the data dissemination phase and of semantic annotations retrieval  respectively  4.1 advertisement pdu in figure 5 the structure of an advertisement pdu is sketched  all the resources inventoried by a reader are advertised by means of a unique advertisement pdu and then the size of the packet increases proportionally with the number of tags in the reader range  in what follows we outline pdu fields  type  the kind of pdu  see table 1   flags  it contains one status flag to distinguish the kind of transmission  uni or broadcast  ; the remaining flags are reserved for future purposes  traveled hops  the number of hops already traversed by the packet  a reader sets this value to 1 and it is increased every time a node forwards the packet  number of resources  how many tags are in the reader radio range  table 1 pdu types exploited in the proposed framework type bit set pdu a 0 advertisement b 1 cache entry c 2 solicit d 3 demand e..l 4..7 reserved advertisement id  the readers sequence number  node sequence number  the sequence number of the node forwarding the packet  if the packet has been sent by a reader this field value coincides with the previous one  source address  the ip address of the reader  resource parameters  a composite  variable length field depending on the number of advertised resources  in particular  it contains the ouuid value  the remaining life time of a resource  the maximum hops number for the advertisement travel  and finally the epc code of the single tag  table 2 constant values used in the framework name default rtime meaning time interval between two consecutive advertisement packet transmissions polling time time a reader node waits for the echo of the advertisements max adv jitter maximum value for random time waited when forwarding advertisement packets one hop wait timer set by a requester node after sending a solicit packet  waiting for cache contents reception hop traversal time time a node needs to process and forward a solicit packet sent by a neighbor ack rtt timer set by a requester node waiting for ack after a solicit has been sent discovery diameter current search diameter  in hops  during discovery phase max retries maximum number of retransmissions before a reader assumes there are no neighbors value 30000 ms 7500 ms 600 ms 2000ms 50ms 50 ms 4 5 a reader which has inventoried a tag series  broadcasts an advertisement every default rtime milliseconds  see table 2 for constant values   nearby nodes forward the packet by broadcasting it to their neighbors ; as a consequence  the reader listens to the echo of the advertisement packet it originally transmitted  thus  it can obtain a confirmation of the presence of other nodes in its neighborhood  if the reader does not receive any echo within polling time milliseconds  less than default rtime   it will retransmit the advertisement  assuming that a collision or a transmission error has occurred  after max retries retries it can be assumed there are no neighbors  so the transmission of the advertisement can be scheduled after a longer timeout in order to reduce power consumption  when a node receives an advertisement  it extracts information about the resources and  in case of new items  it adds cache entries ; otherwise  before updating stored data  the node verifies if the received information is more recent or has ran across a shorter path than the existing one  this happens also when multiple readers attempt to scan the same tag  if the cache is updated and the maximum advertisement diameter has not been reached  then the advertisement is forwarded ; otherwise the whole packet is silently discarded  this simple mechanism grants each mobile node in the network sends the same advertisement at most once  furthermore  in order to reduce the collision probability  recall that mac 802.11 protocol does not provide any acknowledgment frame for broadcast transmission   each host waits a random time t  t  0  max adv jitter   before transmitting  we developed an analytical model of the data dissemination protocol  not reported here due to lack of space  to estimate whether the inclusion of the 96-bit epc code in each resource advertisement could lead to an unacceptable network overhead  let us consider a typical scenario with a partition-free network of 30 readers and 1000 tags per reader  since typical read rates are not above 100 tags/s for epcglobal gen-2 uhf rfid  14   we deem that reasonably the advertisement period default r time should not be set below 30 s ; moreover  let us set max adv diameter=4  in that case  total traffic generated by data dissemination has an upper bound of 590 kb/s  i.e  20 kb/s per reader  furthermore  generated traffic is a linear function of tag population size  thus granting a theoretically acceptable scalability to the system  4.2 demand pdu when starting a matchmaking  a node must firstly look within its cache table for entries compatible with the request and  in case  it must require in unicast the corresponding semantically annotated descriptions from their respective owners  a demand pdus as the one sketched in figure 6 is used  in what follows the meaning of introduced pdu fields is summarized  4.3 type  it is set to 3

requests ; it contains the epcs of the tags whose descriptions are required  solicit pdu basically  the soliciting mechanism is analogous to the advertising one  figure 8 shows the format of a solicit

traveled hops  hops the packet has already gone across  total hops  total hops the pdu has to skip  together with the traveled hops field  it regulates the frame travel  request id  unambiguously

requester elicits information about nearby nodes  it can exactly know the number of neighbors  each node located at discovery diameter hops from the requester  after receiving a solicit pdu  replies with a cache content pdu in unicast toward the node the solicit cames from  readers receiving a cache content pdu update their own cache and recursively sends back a cache content pdu  till the original requester node receives information it needs  4.4 cache table management each reader manages a cache table where it stores characteristics of both tags in its radio range and tags it has seen

corresponding entry of the cache table is updated either if the sequence number within the packet is higher than the one stored or if the route the pdu suggests is shorter than the previously stored

equipped with ieee 802.11 wireless connectivity  hereafter hosts  are responsible for u-kb creation and management  tagged objects represent kb individuals in our system  in our previous work  1  the epcglobal standard was enhanced to support storage and retrieval on rfid tags of an ontology identifier  a set of attributes and a compressed semantic-based annotation  in addition to the epc identifier  these basic elements recur in our definition of an individual in a u-kb  as explained above  for the sake of conciseness  here we omit details of the semantic-enhanced rfid protocol proposed in  1  so assuming the reader be familiar with it  5.2 interactions with epcglobal rfid technology 1 dissemination  after each advertisement period default time  a host scans rfid tags in its range  only semantic enabled tags are preselected  by means of a select command with parameters as shown in table 3 epc codes of semantic based tags are then scanned individually and ttl of corresponding cache table entries are refreshed  if the host detects a new epc code not present in its cache table  it will read its ouuid and contextual attributes  exploiting two read commands  as shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively  data extracted from the rfid tag will be stored in a new cache entry with a fresh sequence number  conversely  if the epc code is not detected for an existing local entry in the cache table  the host will wait for the ttl to expire before removing the entry  this prevents the well-known issue of rfid event flickering2  16  from causing incorrect removal/addition of u-kb individuals  at the end of the loop  the cache table is fully updated and the host can issue an advertisement pdu to notify individuals to neighboring hosts  2 discovery  when a host receives a demand pdu for which it is the destination  it starts an rfid scan of semantic enabled tags only  as seen above  during inventory  for each detected epc among those listed in the pdu payload  it reads the semantically annotated compressed object description stored in the 2 due to collisions  a tag might not be detected in every consecutive scan  this phenomenon can trigger spurious leave-enter event pairs  table 5 read command to extract contextual attributes from user memory bank parameter membank wordptr wordcount value 112 0000000002 000010002 description user memory

provisioning  as already suggested in  1   the epcglobal object naming service  ons  3 can be used as a fallback mechanism for ontology support in ubiquitous computing contexts if an internet connection is available  4 system evaluation  after a feasibility study using ibm websphere rfid middleware  we are currently performing an extensive simulation campaign in ns-2 4 of the full protocol stack  in scenarios with both fixed and moving readers  we expect valuable insight for a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach  in particular w.r.t  network load  duration of service discovery sessions  hit ratio  percentage of successful resource retrieval  and sensitivity to topology variations  due to rfid reader and tag mobility   due to lack of space  we are not able to report here our early findings  6 conclusion building on our previous work  we have presented an approach to carry out an advanced matchmaking using semantic metadata stored in rfid tags without unique and fixed knowledge bases  an advanced resource discovery framework is supported by a knowledge dissemination protocol  so allowing an on-demand retrieval of suitable descriptions directly from tags located on the objects  an analytical model has been developed for a preliminary assessment of resource requirements  while functionality tests have been carried out in a reduced simulation environment  we are
