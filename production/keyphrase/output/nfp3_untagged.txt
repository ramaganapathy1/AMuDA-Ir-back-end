indoor positioning against the ubi-nanoloc indoor positioning  therefore  wlan-based indoor positioning techniques and ubi-nanoloc indoor positioning are summarized in this section  we have already published research papers about these topics  improvement of wlan based indoor positioning with kalman filter  18  and improvement of ubi-nanoloc indoor positioning with kalman filter  19   considering the results of  18  and  19   this paper discusses wlan-based indoor positioning and ubi-nanoloc indoor positioning  2.1 fingerprinting methods the k-nn  k nearest neighbors   4   bayesian  10  16  and decision tree  9  17  methods are representative techniques used in fingerprinting positioning and t hey are briefly summarized in this section 222 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 2.1.1 k-nearest neighbors  18   in k-nn  we build a look-up table in the first phase  or off-line phase  the entire area is covered by a rectangular grid of points called candidate points  at each of these candidate points  we measure the rssis many times  let rssiij denote the j-th received signal strength indicator of the signal sent by api  a row of the look-up table is an ordered pair of  coordinate  a list of rssis   a coordinate is an ordered pair of integers  x  y  representing the coordinates of a candidate point  a list of rssis consists of five integers  rssi1  rssi2   where rssii is the average of rssiij received at  x  y  and sent by api  an example of a look-up table is shown in table 1 in the second phase  or on-line phase  the positioning program gathers the rssis the user receives at the current moment  if the positioning program is running on the users handheld terminal  then the terminal itself will collect the rssis  for example  let x=  40  -56  -54  -69  -66  be the vector of the collected rssis  k-nn  then examines the look-up table and finds the closest candidate point in terms of euclidean distance  for example  euclidean distance  ed  between x and cp1 is  ed =  -40   39  2  56 55  2  54 56  2  69 70  2  66 67  2   among the three candidate points in table 1  cp 2 is the closest one  once k-nn finds the closest one  it returns the candidate point as the users current location  if k equals 2  then it will find the two closest candidate points and return the average of their coordinates as the users current location  table 1 an example look-up table of k-nn  cpi are the coordinates of the i-th candidate points  and api is the mac address of the i-th ap  ap ap1 ap2 ap3 ap4 ap5 -39 -40 -44  -55 -56 -42  -56 -55 -62  -70 -69 -45  -67 -66 -61  candidate points cp1 cp2 cp3  2.1.2 bayesian classification method  18   let rssis  the positioning program will x  x1  x2    xn  be the vector of collected cpi predict p  cpi | x  p  cpj | x  for 1 j m  j i that the users position is if  where  m is the number of candidate points  p  x | cpi  p  cpi  p  cpi | x  p  x  according to bayes theorem   as p  x  is constant for all p  x | cpi  p  cpi  classes  only classification method finds the users position  11   need be maximized  a positioning system using the bayesian cpi that maximizes p  x | cpi  p  cpi   and returns it as the 2.1.3 decision tree  18   in the off-line phase of the decision tree method  17   we build a decision tree with the training data  an example training data set is shown in table 2 table 2 is similar to table 1 the only differences are 1  the rssis are not averages  2  223 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 the rssis are discretized into classes  the number of classes for a given training data set can be decided by the following expression  k 1  log n  /  log 2   where k is the number of classes and n is the number of measurements made at a candidate point  however  our experiments showed that k 5 is appropriate  a class can be represented as an interval  an example discretizing policy can be i1  x | x 30   i 2  x | 40 x 30   i3  x | 50 x 40    given a set of training data  the decision tree method constructs a decision tree as follows  we compute i  or the expected information needed to classify a given sample  with the following expression  m i  s1  s2    sm  pi log 2  pi   i 1 where m is the number of candidate points  s is the number of tuples in the training data set  rows of table   si is the number of rows of training data set in class cpi  and pi si s  then  we compute the entropy  or expected information based on the partitioning of the training data set into subsets by apk  let apk have v distinct values   a1  a2    av   apk can be used to partition s into v subsets   s1  s 2    sv   where s j contains those samples in s that have the value a j of apk  let s ij be the number of samples of class cpi in a subset s j  the entropy e  apk  is given by v sij  smj j 1 s e  apk  i  sij    smj   finally  we compute the information gain g  apk  by the following expression  gain  apk  i  s1  s2    sm  e  cpi   we then create a node for the decision tree and label it apk  where gain  apk  gain  api  for 1 i number of aps  for each a j of apk  we build a reduced training data set and recursively repeat the above process to create child nodes until the training data set is empty or the cp values of all of the rows are the same  table 2 example training data tuples  cpi are the coordinates of the i-th candidate point  api is the mac address of the i-th ap  and i stands for interval  ap ap1 ap2 ap3 ap4 ap5 cp1 i2 i1 i1 i1 i5 i1 i5 i1 cp2 i3

base stations   nn  x n yn z n  to a mobile terminal  m  x y z  as shown in fig  1  then we can estimate the coordinates of m by using trilateration  by squaring  we can obtain the following expression for ri 2  n1  x1 y1 z1   t t t  x x i  2  y yi  2  z zi  2 ri2   for i 1  2    n  figure 1 a diagram to illustrate trilateration by subtracting r12 from ri 2  i 2   n   we have ax b  where

implementation 3.1 wlan-based trilateration we implemented the trilateration on a laptop equipped with an intel  r  pro/wireless 2200bg network connection lan card  we used microsoft visual c # 2005 as our development tool  we measured the rssis at a certain point in the test bed 225 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 many times at different moments as shown in table 3 the first row of the table indicates that rssi value was -84 when we scanned wlan card at 17:00 jan/26 th  -81 when we scanned it at 18:00 the same day and so on  for each of the aps  we scanned rssi values 300 times at every 1m from the ap and obtained the average of them  an example result of these experiments is shown in table 4 using the values in table 4  we can find the relation of the distance and rssi as shown in figure 4 using the expression shown in figure 4  we obtain the distance from the measured rssi  table 3 example rssi values scanned at different

ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration  19  rssi is so noisy that the wlan-based trilateration is very erroneous  therefore  they established ieee 802.15.4 a where the distance is determined by the speed of rf  299,792,458 meter/second  and tof  time of flight   hanbaek electronic 's ubi nanoloc mote shown in fig  4 complies with ieee 820.15.4 a if a sound were used instead of a radio  the measured distance would be much more accurate  because the speed of sound  about 334 meter/second  is much slower than that of a radio  however  229 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 an ultrasonic generator consumes much more power than a radio generator does  an ubi-nanoloc contains a nanoloc produced by nanotron a germany company and a atmega microprocessor  the nonoloc estimates tof and the atmega computes the distance with the tof  this paper introduces our experiments of indoor positioning with ubi-nanolocs  figure 4 a ubi-nanoloc mote  19  figure 5 our test bed  the stars represent the base station  19  an indoor positioning kit has 5 ubi-nanoloc motes  4 of them are used as base stations and one of them is used as a sink node  the 4 base stations send their data to the sink node  the sink node estimates the distances of the 4 base stations and performs the trilateration process to compute its location  then  the sink node sends those distances and its location to our pc  our test bed was the rooms labeled 4121 and 4122 in figure 5 the wall between these rooms is removable and we removed it and put the base stations at the 4 corners of the test bed  the base stations are represented as stars in figure 5 the coordinates of the locations of the 4 base stations are shown in table 6 table 7 coordinates

 2  april  2012 before running the ubi-nanoloc indoor program  we have to initialize a few variables as shown in table 7 we set modemdevice with the com port number through which the pc communicates with the sink node  the ubi -nanoloc indoor program uses node 1 as the base position  therefore  the coordination of node 1 should be  0  0   the coordinates of the other nodes are corresponding to

experimental analysis the graphical user interface  gui  of our trilateration-based positioning system is shown in fig  6 the floor plan shown in fig  6 represents the 4 th floor of the natural science building  our test bed  when the button  location ?  is clicked  the system runs our trilateration algorithm and writes the x and y coordinates returned by the algorithm in the box labeled position info  it also marks a big dot at  x  y  on the floor plan  when the button  test  is clicked  it provides dialog boxes in which the actual users location and an integer n can be input  then  it runs our trilateration algorithm n times and records the results in the file named result  figure 6 a typical gui of the wlan-based trilateration positioning program 231 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 there are many parameters affecting the efficiency of a positioning system and the number of aps with significant signal strengths is one of them  if the rssi from an ap is less than -70 then the distance to the ap can not readily be determined with the rssi and we consider it insignificant  in the experiments  we used 4 aps with significant signal strengths  we tested the wlan-based trilateration indoor program at 40 different locations  at each location  we estimated the position 300 times  after these experiments  we concluded that the average error of the wlan-based trilateration indoor program is about 4.1 meters  a typical gui of our ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration indoor positioning program is shown in figure 7 as it is shown on the buttons labeled 4  5 and 6 we have implemented not only the trilateration but also the kalman filter processes  we can paste a sequence of x  y coordinates as input data for the kalman filter processes in the textbox labeled 1 in figure 7 the textbox labeled 2 is for output of the program  for the test our ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration indoor positioning program  we performed five sets of experiments  one of them was performed while we walked through the path shown in figure 8 figure 7 a typical gui of our ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration indoor positioning program figure 8 the path we walked through for the experiment 232 international journal of multimedia and ubiquitous engineering vol  7  no  2  april  2012 while we walked through the path shown in fig  8  we ran the ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration indoor positioning program  we walked the path 100 times and compared the output with the coordinates of the path  with the comparison  we concluded that the average error of the ubi-nanoloc-based trilateration indoor positioning is 1.257 meter  5 conclusion positioning is an essential technique for implementing lbs systems  for indoor lbs  a practical indoor positioning program must be available  nowadays  wlan is available almost anywhere and wlan-based indoor positioning program would be economically practical  the fingerprinting methods are widely studied for walnbased indoor positioning  but they are not practical because they require tedious and time consuming off-line phase  an alternative choice could be wlan-based trilateration  however  this is too erroneous when it estimates the distances with an rf propagation loss model  another alternative choice could be time of flight  tof  based trilateration  in order to evaluate this choice  we tested the ubi-nanoloc-based  this estimates distances with tof  trilateration indoor positioning an d found that it is pretty accurate  from these tests  we can conclude that a mobile device should be equipped with something similar to ubi-nanoloc mote in order to accelerate growth of indoor lbs markets  acknowledgements this research was supported by basic science
