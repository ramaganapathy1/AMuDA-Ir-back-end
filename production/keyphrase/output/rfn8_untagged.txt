identication code  epc  associated with a tag  such tags are very useful in inventory management and logistics  because they can be used in order to track the movement and locations of large volumes of items in a cost eective way  this leads to massive streams of noisy data  which can be used in the context of a variety of data management and event processing algorithms  the use of rfid also has a number of privacy challenges associated with it  because a tag on an item being carried by a person  also becomes a unique location tag for that person  therefore  methods need to to be designed to increase the privacy and security of rfid technology  this chapter will provide a broad overview and survey of a variety of rfid data management  mining and processing techniques  we will also discuss the privacy and security issues associated with the use of rfid technology  keywords  rfid data  rfid mining 350 1 managing and mining sensor data introduction rfid technology is a recent sensor technology  which allows uniquely identiable tags to be read from a distance with the use of a sensor reader  rfid sensor technology is useful for tracking very large volumes of items with specic identiability in a cost eective way  when combined with more sophisticated sensors transmitting real-time information and internet-enabled web services  this allows real-time connectivity and tracking of information about a wide variety of objects in daily life  the capability has been recognized in sensor computing as a paradigm shift in how objects are tracked in a ubiquitous manner  and is generally referred to as the internet of things  8   at the most basic level  the denition of radio frequency identication  rfid  is as follows  rfid is a technology which allows a sensor  reader  to read  from a distance  and without line of sight  a unique product identication code  epc  associated with a tag  34   thus  the unique code from the tag is transmitted to one or more sensor reader  s   which in turn  transmit  s  the readings to one or more server  s   the data at the server is aggregated in order to track all the dierent product codes which are associated with the tags  passive rfid tags do not require an onboard battery  and can typically be read from a distance of a few centimeters to a few meters  passive tags are typically powered by the radio signal that reads them  on the other hand  active tags come equipped with an onboard battery  which provides larger read ranges  if the tags are equipped with a suciently powerful antenna  it is also possible for them to transmit very long range signals  such as enabling the readability of the signal from satellites  while active tags have larger ranges  they come at a larger unit cost  and also have limited life spans  for most retail applications  passive tags are used in order to minimize the costs associated with the infrastructure  the primary xed cost of such an infrastructure is embedded in the hardware and software associated with the sensor readers  whereas the variable costs of this system are associated with the rfid tags  each of which needs to be axed to a tracked item  typically  the number of sensor readers being used in large scale applications  such as retail tracking  is relatively small compared to the number of objects being tracked  for example  in a typical retail application  each tracking point will have a small number of sensor readers  which keep track of a very large volume of rfid tags passing through that point  rfid sensors vary from conventional sensor technology in a variety of ways  with most sensors  whether mobile or stationary   the objects or readings which are sensed are not done so actively  and are usually not a survey of rfid data processing 351 powered by a sensor reader  conventional sensors are used in conjunction with a battery for tracking  and wireless transmission of  readings such as ambient sound  temperature  light  videos  pressure  locations  or other objects  which are then transmitted by the sensor itself  in the case of rfid  the key is to identify specic information in the tag  by powering it with a sensor reader  this specic information in the tag is also known as electronic product identication code  epc   the uniqueness of identication code  and the cost-eectiveness of the tag  allows the simultaneous tracking of a large number of objects  since the presence of an object at a particular location can be associated with the identication code on its tag  while the core idea of rfid technology is not new  and dates back to world war ii for distinguishing between friendly and enemy aircrafts  53  50   recent years have seen the emergence of a new stripped down version of the tag  which lacks a power source or antenna  and does little more than provide a unique identier  unlike regular sensors  such tags are extremely inexpensive  cost no more than a few cents each  and can easily be constructed for large scale applications  some of the earliest discussions on the the rapid advancement of rfid technology to such large scale applications may be found in  56  71   the trend towards  smaller  unobtrusive  and inexpensive tags is exemplied by the following  zebra has developed a print engine  which can embed an rfid transponder directly into a product label  16   hitachi has developed an extremely tiny rfid tag  known as the -chip  which can be directly embedded into photocopier paper  81   this can be used for document tracking  these dierent kinds of developments suggest the continuing miniaturization of rfid technology across dierent domains  furthermore  these developments also suggest that the applications of rfid technology go well beyond retail applications  it is important to note that the complexity of an rfid tag can be fairly exible  depending upon the problem domain  if desired  it is possible to incorporate sensing into rfid technology  71  72  with the use of onboard sensors that generate data dynamically  for example  an rfid tag may incorporate a temperature sensor  for perishable goods   or a passive force sensor  which can return information about the possible damage to a product  if it is dropped  such tags are typically active rfid tags  with an onboard battery   and they are typically more expensive than passive tags  which are powered by a sensor reader  and return only the epc  the par 352 managing and mining sensor data ticular choice of the tag depends upon the application domain  and an acceptable price-point for the tag in that application domain  thus  the broad exibility in the functionality of rfid tags  makes them widely applicable to dierent problem domains  examples of such domains are as follows  retail applications  in retail applications  rfid tags are associated with the products  and xed sensor readers at particular locations are used in order to track the movement of products  the technique can be used for real-time inventory tracking  alternatively  active shelves can be used in order to determine product availability  the internet of things  ubiquitous computing  which is also referred to as the internet of things  has been identied as a key trend in recent years  in which information about objects is continuously tracked with the use of sensor technology  along with a host of other advances in embedded sensor technology  rfid has been identied to be one of the key enabling technologies towards this trend  74   the application of rfid technology for enabling such ubiquitous computing requires the coupling of basic rfid technology with the relevant web and internet services for allowing ubiquitous tracking  in particular  the ability to simultaneously identify a large number of objects uniquely in a cost-eective way with rfid tags has been a driving force in this direction  medical applications  rfid has increasingly found acceptance in a variety of pervasive healthcare applications  67   for example  the tags may be associated with the patient medical history  this can be useful for automated tracking of patient medical history  for rfid-enabled healthcare asset management  major healthcare equipments  such as wheelchairs or other medical equipments are rfid-tagged  so that health-care experts can locate any asset in real-time  this can also help increase emergency room safety in addition to time saving  68   payment systems  rfid tags are used as credit-card like payment tokens that contain a serial number  when the tag is scanned for a payment  the reader transmits the number over a network to a remote computer  which is authorized to debit the money from the consumers back account  an example of such a payment system is texas instrumentss speedpass  pay-at-pump system  which was introduced in mobil stations in the mid-nineties  a survey of rfid data processing 353 access control  the transmitters which are mounted on vehicles emit a signal which is read by the sensors at the tolls  this is used to keep track of the number of accesses through the toll  and also control the access of the vehicle through the toll  a popular such system is the new yorks ezpass  which is equipped with a 921.75 mhz semi-passive tag  access control to commercial buildings and installations for employees and workers is often managed with the use of cards with rfid chips embedded in them  animal movement  animals can be implanted with rfid tags in order to trace their movement  alternatively  pet owner information can also be implanted on the rfid tag  both kinds of tags can be useful in locating a lost pet  or in tracking the patterns of movement of wild life  more sophisticated tags  equipped with gps receivers and transmitters  have been used in order to transmit signals that can be picked up by satellite  and have been used to track aquatic animals and other wild life  library tracking  rfid technology can be be used in order to automate the tracking of items which are checked out from the library by patrons  such rfid tags also serve as security devices with the use of exit sensors  which track items that are being removed from the library  but have not been checked out  for example  several libraries such as the santa clara city library in california  the university of nevada  las vegas library  and the eugene  oregon public library have already tagged every book  tape  cd  or other item in their collection  55   airline luggage management  in this case  the rfid chips are attached to the luggage tags  therefore  by placing sensor readers at strategic locations  it is possible to track the movement of luggage  this has been shown to be very useful in reducing lost luggage  54  66   automobile immobilizers  some of the newer car models have keys which contain an rfid tag  this key is authenticated by the steering column  and is required for vehicle operation  such immobilizers typically have a small read range of a few centimeters  and operate in the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum  such systems have been widely credited with greatly reducing auto theft  even though rfid technology has been around for many years  its use for large scale applications  has only recently found widespread acceptance  the massive nature of rfid data is associated with numerous 354 managing and mining sensor data challenges from the perspective of mining and analysis  these challenges are as follows  the volume of data associated with rfid can be extremely large  because of the large number of tags which may be tracked by a single reader  furthermore  in some applications  the number of readers may also be quite large  which leads to a high fan-in and hierarchical organization of the underlying sensor network  23   such a system poses numerous challenges  because successive hierarchical aggregation of streams from dierent nodes of the network can lead to a overwhelming amount of data at the higher level nodes  it has been argued in  23  that a uniform stream-oriented query processing approach at all levels of the hierarchy works best in such systems  the data can be very noisy and redundant  with many tags being completely dropped  and others being read by multiple readers at multiple instants  resulting in tremendous redundancy of the representation  furthermore  the large volume of the data makes the process of cleaning much more challenging  therefore  eective methods need to be designed to compress and clean such data  the cleaning process can be rather expensive  and challenging  especially when near real-time responses to location queries are required  many applications such as high level semantic event detection can be extremely challenging because of the high volume of the stream  and the real time nature of such applications  the noise and errors in the underlying data can lead to additional ambiguities during the event detection process  rfid deployments lead to a number of privacy concerns  because tags are uniquely identiable by readers  therefore  by carrying a tag attached to clothing  it may be possible to covertly track people without their knowledge  a variety of methods need to be designed in order to increase the privacy and security aspects of rfid technology  as with any sensor infrastructure  rfid technology and readers vulnerable to partial or complete system failures  such failures can also lead to challenges in data processing  because data which is not collected will always be missing from the database  if the missing data is not explicitly accounted for by the underlying data analytics  it may lead to inaccurate inferences  because the missing a survey of rfid data processing 355 data may be interpreted as the absence of a particular item  rather than a system failure  the chapter will discuss the processes involved in the storage  management and cleaning of rfid data  the chapter is organized as follows  in the next section  we will discuss the process of rfid data cleaning and compression  in section 3  we will discuss issues in the data management and warehousing of rfid data  an important goal of tracking rfid data is to use it for detecting interesting semantic events in the data  especially in real-time streaming scenarios  section 4 discusses methods for event detection from rfid data streams  section 5 discusses issues related to privacy and security of rfid data  section 6 contains the conclusions and summary  2 raw rfid data cleaning and compression a variety of middleware architectures are used in order to collect and process rfid data  11  22  33  37  80  68   rfid data  by its very nature  is extremely noisy  incomplete and redundant because of cross-reads from multiple sensor readers  for example  it has been shown  38  65  that a large fraction of the readings in rfid streams are essentially dropped  it has been estimated in  38  65   that as many as 30 % of the sensor readings are lost  i.e  the tag identiers do not appear at all   because of the reader unreliability  therefore  rfid middleware systems are used in order to correct for dropped readings  a commonly used method in many data cleaning systems  33  80  is to use a temporal smoothing lter  in which a sliding window over the readers data stream interpolates for lost readings from each tag within the time window  this approach provides each tag more opportunities to be read within the smoothing window  this reduces the number of distinct tags which are lost  because they will show up in one or more tag readings  when the window size is increased  typically  the window size is xed  as in  22   and the smoothing is performed on the basis of the readings which are received within this xed window  it has been observed in  36   that the choice of window size can be a critical parameter  which leads to dierent tradeos between false positives and false negatives  using a window size which is too small will lead to missed readings  or false negatives   because the tag has fewer opportunities to be scanned by the reader  on the other hand  a larger window size will cause false positives  because it will lead to scanned readings  even after the tag has moved out of the readers detection range  the work in  36  proposes smurf  statistical smoothing for unreliable rfid data   which is an adaptive smoothing lter for raw rfid data streams  356 managing and mining sensor data this technique determines the most eective window size automatically  and continuously changes it over the course of the rfid stream  depending upon the underlying readings  one characteristic of this approach is that it does not expose the smoothing window parameter to the particular application at hand  this makes the approach much more exible in dierent scenarios  the approach proposed in  36  views rfid readings as unequal probability random sample of tags in the physical world  therefore  the tradeo between reader unreliability and tag dynamics can be explored in a principled and statistical manner  furthermore  the approach can be used to clean both single-tag and multiple-tag readings  in the multiple tag case  it is assumed that single readings do not need to be tracked  for example  a store may only need to track when the number of items of a particular type falls below a given threshold  for the single tag case  binomial sampling methods are used for the cleaning process  for the multi-tag case  the aggregate signal over a tag population is cleaned with the use of horvitz-thompson estimators  one characteristic of eective cleaning methods is to use declarative methods in the cleaning process  38  39  36   the broad idea is to specify cleaning stages with the use of high-level declarative queries over relational data streams  once this is done  the system can translate the queries into the required low level operations  such an approach is useful in helping programmers avoid writing low level interaction code  by specifying the queries at the high level  furthermore  such an approach makes the system data and device-independent  and the code does not need to be changed if the underlying device fails  or is upgraded  we note that the middleware approach to rfid data cleaning performs all the processing on the data upfront  before applying any of the data querying or analytical methods on it  however  dierent applications may dene the anamolies or corrections on the same data set in a dierent way  therefore  the method in  59  introduces a deferred approach for detecting and correcting rfid anamolies  each application uses declarative sequence-based rules in order specify  detect  and correct relevant anamolies  we note that this approach is generally different from the methods proposed in  22  36   which make the cleansing process application-independent  clearly  both approaches have their own advantages in dierent scenarios  the generally accepted principle  22  is that the separation of the middleware from the applications is a desirable goal  because of the diversity of the applications in which such data could be used  and the network limitations of the underlying readers  a survey of rfid data processing 357 the actual process of cleaning may be much more complicated in an application containing thousands of readers and millions of tags  in such a case  the process of cleaning may incur tremendous costs associated with the entire process  these costs may be associated with either the cleaning plan itself  or in the misclassication associated with the cleaned data records  therefore  a method for cost-conscious cleaning of massive rfid data sets has been proposed in  27   the work in  27  assumes that three dierent kinds of inputs are available  a set of tag readings are available  which form a representative sample of the possible set of readings  each reading is associated with a correct location of the tag  contextual information  area conditions  and tag protocol  a set of cleaning methods with associated per-tuple cleaning costs are specied  a per-tuple mis-classication cost is specied  which may be constant  a function of the tag reading and incorrectly assigned location  the goal of the cost-sensitive approach is to learn a cleaning plan that identies the conditions  feature values  under which a specic cleaning method or a sequence of cleaning methods should be applied in order to minimize the expected cleaning costs  including error costs  the work in  27  proposes a cleaning method which dynamically adjusts the probability of tag-presence based on the last observation  this is essentially a dynamic bayesian network  dbn  approach  it has been shown in  27  that such an approach can outperform or complement methods which are based on smoothing windows  one advantage of dbn-based cleaning is that it does not require the use of recent tag readings  as in a window-based method   and it also gives more importance to recent readings  since the probability of tag-presence is continuously adjusted by the incoming tag readings  a method called streamclean has been proposed in  46   which uses global integrity constraints in order to clean the data  the core idea in streamclean is that the tuples in a data stream system are not random  but are often related to one another  according to application-specic criteria  an example of such an integrity constraint provided in  46  can be as follows  a car parked in the garage at time te < t must either have exited in  te  t   or it must still be parked at time t in essence  the approach in streamclean requires the specication of 358 managing and mining sensor data user-stated properties that are true about the data  the system then uses these properties in order to insert missing tuples or correct conicting tuples  in the event of groups of conicting tuples  a probability of correctness is assigned to each tuple  thus  the streamclean approach transform the data to a probabilistic representation  in which explicit probability values are assigned to tuples  the approach then transforms constraints on the tuples into constraints on the underlying probability values  this also allows the possibility of soft constraints  in which a probability of a fact being correct is specied  rather than a hard constraint  in which the fact is deterministically known to be correct  the streamclean method uses a non-linear optimization method  where the objective is to determine a probability assignment that maximizes entropy while satisfying the integrity constraints  the intuition behind maximizing entropy  32  is that in the absence of additional knowledge  the underlying solutions should be as uniform as possible  for example  the use of entropy maximization results in the explicit assumption  that in the absence of stated constraints  the probabilities of dierent input tuples are independent of each other  while this may not necessarily be true in all solutions  it is the most reasonable assumption to make in the absence of prior beliefs about such tuples  it has been observed in  29  that rfid data exhibits a considerable amount of redundancy because of multiple scans of the same item  even when it is stationary at a given location  in practice  one needs to track only interesting movements and activities on the item  this is an issue which we will discuss in some detail in the next section on data management and warehousing  rfid tag readings also exhibit a considerable amount of spatial redundancy because of scans of the same object from the rfid readers placed in multiple zones  this is primarily because of the spatial overlap in the range of dierent sensor readers  this provides seemingly inconsistent readings because of the inconsistent  virtual  locations reported by the dierent sensors scanning the same object  it has been observed in  15  that the redundancy is both a blessing and a curse  while the redundancy causes inconsistent readings  it also provides useful information about the location of an object in cases  where the intended reader fails to perform its intended function  in addition  it has been observed in  15   that a considerable amount of background information is often available  which can be used in order to enhance accuracy  this background information is as follows  prior knowledge about tagged objects and readers can be used in order to improve accuracy  a survey of rfid data processing 359 information about the constraints in the underlying application  such as the maximum capacity of a room or shelf  can be used in order to improve accuracy  the work in  15  proposes a bayesian inference framework  which takes full advantage of the duplicate readings  and the additional background information in order to maximize the accuracy of rfid data collection  a dierent method  proposed in  52   is to use a kernel density-based probability cleaning method  kleap  to remove cross-reads within a sliding window  the method estimates the density of each tag using a kernel-based function  the idea is that the most relevant reader will have a much larger number of objects in a similar position as this object  therefore  the reader corresponding to the micro-cluster with the largest density will be regarded as the relevant position of the tagged object in the current window  the reads which are derived from the other readers will be treated as cross-reads  3 rfid data management and warehousing some of the earliest work on temporal management of rfid data was proposed in  68   this work develops a dynamic relationship er  drer  model for temporal management of rfid data  this system is built on top of the er model with relatively few extensions  the technique maintains the history of events and state changes  so that complex queries can be supported  a rules-based framework is used to transform business logic data into user congured rules  in addition to location  another concept which is introduced is that of containment  containment implies a hierarchical relationship between a set of objects  for example  a pallet may be loaded with cases  and both the pallet and the cases would have their own separate epcs  the rfid data contains two basic categories of data  corresponding to static and dynamic data  the static data is related to commercial entities such as location information  product level information  and serial information  there are two kinds of dynamic data   a  the rst corresponds to instance data such as serial number and the date of manufacture ; and  b  the second corresponds to temporal data such as location observations and temporal changes in the containment of objects  the second kind of temporal data are captured through epc tag readings  and is related to the movement of products  the four primary kinds of entities which interact with one another in such a system are epc-tagged objects  readers  locations  and transactions  these entities interact with one another  as object locations change  and entity containment relationships change as well  we note that even sensor  reader  360 managing and mining sensor data locations may change over time  as they are moved from one place to the other  besides state changes  events are also generated in the interactions  including observations  when epc tags interact with readers  and transacted items  when an object participates in a transaction  the dynamic entity-relation model  drer  is an extension of the er model  in the er model  all entities and relationships are static or current  in the rfid system  entities are static  but the relationships between them are dynamic  thus  the only addition to the traditional er model is the addition of a new kind of relationship  known as the dynamic relationship  there are two kinds of dynamic relationships  one of which generates events  and the other generates state history  an eventbased dynamic relationship is associated with a single attribute known as timestamp  which represents the time at which the event occurred  on the other hand  a state-based dynamic relationship is associated with two attributes tstart and tend corresponding to when the state started and ended  thus  in the drer model  we have three dierent static entities corresponding to sensor reader  object  and location  in addition  an entity called transaction may be used in order to represent business transactions  though we omit it in the discussion here for simplicity  each of the static entities is associated with its own set of static entity tables  state-based dynamic relationships correspond to sensor location  object location  and containment  we note that each of these relationships are dynamic  and naturally have a starting and ending time  event-based dynamic relationships occur at a particular instant  and may correspond to an observation  which is generated by a sensor reading an epc tag  the dierent static and dynamic tables in the drer model  together with their attributes are summarized below  entity type table attributes sensor object location observation containment obj  location sens  location static static static dyn  dyn  dyn  dyn  sensor  sensor epc  name  description  object  object epc  name  description  location  location id  name  owner  observation  sensor epc  value  timestamp  containment  epc  parent epc  tstart  tend  objectlocation  epc  location id  tstart  tend  sensorlocation  sensor epc  location id  position  tstart  tend  these tables can be used in conjunction with a variety of sql queries in order to resolve interesting aspects about the rfid objects  some examples  68  of such queries are as follows  rfid object tracking queries  the objectlocation table carries a survey of rfid data processing 361 most of the information needed for formulating rfid location tracking queries  since the starting and ending time for each object is included in the table  a query can be performed on an epc in order to determine the history of locations for that objects  the precise time taken for an object to move from one location to another can also be derived because of the presence of the tstart and tend variables  this history of locations can be sorted temporally in order to provide the history of locations for any object  similarly  missing objects at a location can be obtained from the objectlocation table by comparing the objects at that location  with the set of objects at any time and location  where they were previously known to be complete  the precise formulation of these queries is provided in  68   rfid data monitoring queries  it is also formulate containment or observation queries for any particular snapshot by making use of the containment  objectlocation and observation queries  in addition temporal joins can be performed between dierent objects by formulating queries which examine the overlap between their tstart and tend variables  for example  recursive containment can be easily queried with this approach with the use of containment table  and temporal aggregation can be performed on the number of items which passed through a location at a given time  by making use of the tstart and tend attributes of the objectlocation table  thus  the tables supported by the drer model are expressive and can support a wide range of sql queries  68   we note that in order to transform the noisy rfid into the high level semantic tables discussed above  which are consistent and nonredundant  a number of rules need to be dened  these rules correspond to data ltering  location transformation  and data aggregation  we note that many relationship tables  such as containment tables  are not explicitly specied in the rfid data  and they need to be inferred and aggregated  based on the observation patterns  a rule-based framework is proposed in  68  in order to automate the transformation of primitive events into semantically cleaner representations  for example  a data ltering rule can be dened to scan the data within a sliding window in order to determine if there are duplicates of the same event in multiple readers  one of these can then be dropped  similarly  when a new location for an object is dened by a particular reader  the ending time stamp for the last location is updated to the current time  an entry is created in the objectlocation table which a new starting time stamp  which is the current time  the ending time-stamp for the new entry is set to uc  until changed   this is an example of a location transformation rule  an example of a data aggregation rule is one in which 362 managing and mining sensor data when a set of pallets are loaded onto a track  the set of epc readings for all the objects are inserted as the children of the epc of the truck  in the containment table  thus  an event detector continuously monitors the observation streams  and triggers actions which generate the corresponding data  one challenge with managing rfid data  which was noticed in  68  was that rfid data typically have very large volume  which can lead to accumulation of large volumes of data  this can lead to slower queries and updates  an important observation about rfid data is that they typically have a limited life span  starting from the time it is rst tagged  to the time when it is sold to the customer  therefore  the database management approach in  68  partitions the data into an active set of rfid data  which corresponds to items which are frequently updated ; and an inactive set of data  which corresponds to items that are no longer updated frequently  since the majority of the data becomes inactive over time  this leads to much faster queries of the active data during its lifecycle  3.1 ecient warehousing of rfid data a related  but somewhat dierent kind of rfid data management and warehousing has been discussed in  29   this approach is designed towards nding the relevant paths of items in the rfid scenario  this process is also designed towards modeling the dynamic relationships such as containment  except that it does so not just for explicit containment  but also for items which move together  also  the mapping relationships are modeled somewhat dierently  the approach is also designed for tracking specic measures associated with the rfid items  which is typical in a data warehouse  as in the case of  68   methods need to be designed to handle the massive redundancy of dierent types  these could be because of multiple readings of the same item from the same reader at multiple times  consider the situation  where a typical reading from an rfid tag is of the form  ep c  location  t ime   we note that the same tag may be read many times at the same location  even though no signicant event may have occurred involving the time  as in  68   the only two readings which are signicant are the rst and last moment at which the items were read  the work in  29  uses two main kinds of compression  temporal compression  multiple scans of the same code at the same  virtual  location can be compressed signicantly  for example  if an item is loaded on an ship from one port to another  then the virtual location of the item corresponds to ship and all scans a survey of rfid data processing 363 of the item aboard the ship can be reduced to two scans  in practice  the location is associated with the identier of a xed sensor reader with a virtual location  such as ship  these two scans correspond to the time that the item was loaded on the ship  and the time at which the item was removed from the ship  therefore  by storing the times when the item was rst moved to the vicinity of the reader and the time that it was moved away from the reader  all the relevant information is represented  29   this allows us to represent the item in the form  ep c  location  t imein  t imeout   we note that the t imein and t imeout variables are similar to the tstart and tend variables proposed in  68  for maintaining the object location tables  group-based compression  in most real scenarios  rfid items often move together in groups or consignments  for example  all items which are loaded onto the ship stay together throughout the trip  therefore  all the individual rfid of the items can be replaced by a single generalized identier  or gid  in practice  groups of items may split or merge  as items are loaded at ports from different sources  or split into dierent destinations  correspondingly  the generalized identiers can be arranged hierarchically  in order to eectively represent these merges and splits  one challenge with the use of rfid data with traditional data warehousing techniques  is that traditional warehousing methods do not properly consider the spatial links between dierent data records  which are essential in the rfid scenario  therefore  traditional dare warehousing techniques may fail  when they are directly applied to rfid data  for example  consider the situation  where the cleaned rfid representation is of the form  ep c  location  t imein  t imeout  m easure   where measure could correspond to a value such as the quantity of the item present at the given location  such a representation could be used in order to respond to queries such as the number of items which are present at a given location at any given period  however  it can not be used to determine the number of items which moved from one location to another in a given period  at least with traditional data warehousing operations  therefore  rfid warehouses can be represented in the form of three dierent tables  29    a  an info table which contains location independent information about the items  such as its sku  product type etc   b  a stay table which essentially contains all the set of facts in the form  ep c  location  t imein  t imeout  m easure   or in aggregate form as gids instead of epcs   and  c  a map table which contains the links 364 managing and mining sensor data between the dierent records of the fact table  the map table links together the dierent records in the table which form a path  we note that the map table is the only additional information which needs to be maintained in the case of an rfid data warehouse  the rfid warehouse can be viewed as a multi-level database  in which the lowest level of representation are the raw rfid records  whereas the higher levels contain the cleansed and compressed records  in addition to the use of group-wise movements for compressing the data  a variety of other abstractions can be used for further compression  for example  if a minimum time granularity of one hour is required  then the set of movements and stays occurring in a single hour can be consolidated into a single movement  similarly  the location can be specied at a higher level of granularity  and the sizes and the types of products can also be consolidated  this is because users are often interested in queries at much higher abstraction levels  many path segments which are less important can also be eliminated and consolidated into a single movement  for example  for a store manager  the movement of items between shelves may not be important  and can either be eliminated or consolidated with some other movement  all of these operations signicantly reduce the size of the representation  and make higher level query processing operations much more ecient  some other characteristics of the dierent kinds of tables such as the info table  stay table  and map table are as follows  the info table contains path-independent dimensions  each dimension can have an associated concept hierarchy on which olap operations can be performed  for example  one could drill down on a particular product category and support aggregate queries on this category  the stay table contains the timein and timeout information for the dierent products  in order to save space  this information is stored in terms of aggregated gids of items which move together  rather than the individual epc values  the map table contains the hierarchy of gids in the data  each entry is of the form  gid   gid1    gidr    this implies that gid points to gid1    gidr  we note that at the lower levels  gidk could correspond to an individual epc  the higher levels of the gid  are also labeled with locations  with one identier corresponding to each location for items in the gid  we note that the use of the gids  as maintained by the mapping table can provide a very ecient way to perform the queries  since each a survey of rfid data processing 365 individual gid may contain a very large number of items which have traveled together  in order to materialize the measures such as counts the algorithm does not need to access the counts of the individual epcs  it has been observed in  30  that the movement trails of rfid data form gigantic commodity owgraphs  which represent the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item  the work in  30  proposes a method to construct a warehouse of commodity ows  which is also referred to as a flowcube  similar to olap  the model comprises cuboids  which aggregate the item ows at a given abstraction level  in this case  the measure of each cell is a commodity owgraph  which captures the major movements and trends  as well as signicant deviations from the trend in each cell  the owgraph can also be viewed at multiple levels by changing the abstraction levels of path stages  the latter is achieved by performing simultaneous aggregation of paths to all interesting abstraction levels  in addition  path segments with low frequency and rarely occurring cells are removed from the representation  it has been observed in  28  that a clustered path database  which is natural to rfid applications  can be naturally modeled as a compressed probabilistic workow  each location corresponds to an activity  and locations are linked according to their order of occurrence  a link between two activities has a probability  which represents the percentage of time that one of the activities occurred immediately after the other  a probabilistic representation of the workow can also be used in the context of the flowcube  the details of such a concrete probabilistic workow are provided in  28   4 semantic event extraction from rfid data streams the discussion so far has focussed on low level cleaning  event extraction and data management of rfid  however  in many applications  the events to be discovered are high level semantic events  as opposed to the primitive event of an object moving from one location to another  such events are also referred to as complex events  the problem of event mining in rfid processing is related to previous research on complex event detection in active databases and high fan in sensor systems  1  7  13  14  18  26  62  76  70  79   in particular  the work in  62  discusses a high fan-in architecture for a sensor network  and shows how it can be used in order to process complex events by combining rfid data with other kinds of sensor readings and stored data  an example of such a high-level semantic event discussed in  78  is the shoplifting example  in which the event corresponds to an item be 366 managing and mining sensor data ing picked up at a shelf and then being taken out of the store without being checked out  clearly  a sequence of occurrence or non-occurrence of primitive rfid events can be used to determine the occurrence of a higher level semantic event  the problem of complex event extraction is probably one of the most critical ones in rfid event processing  because the purpose of tracking rfid data is essentially to determine dierent kinds of semantic events based on application-specic criteria  therefore  an expressive and user-friendly language is required to support this class of queries for event processing  a language called sase was proposed in  78  for complex event processing over rfid data streams  the sase event language is a declarative language that combines ltering  correlation and transformation of simpler events  in order to determine how they are correlated on the basis of time and value constraints  the sase language uses the following form in order to determine events  event < event pattern >  where < qualification >   within < window >  for example  the shoplifting event pattern can be captured using the following construct  78   event seq  shelf-reading x  !  counter-reading y   exit-reading z  where x.id = y.id x.id = z.id within 12 hours we note that the event clause of the above contains a seq construct  which species a set of  primitive  events in a particular order  in this case  the construct detects a shelf reading  followed by the absence of a counter reading  and then followed by an exit reading  the seq construct turns out to be quite useful in the context of a wide variety of rfid queries  because of its ability to detect sequential combinations of basic events  such sequential combinations form the core of event detection in complex rfid scenarios  the basic constructs such as seq and negation are already available in the existing languages  however  in the context of rfid data  a number of new features are added by the work in  78   such as the use of parameterized predicates for correlating events via value-bed constraints  sliding windows are used for imposing temporal constraints  methods are also proposed for resolving the semantic subtlety of negation  when used together with sliding windows  a query plan in the sase language uses a subset of the following six operators in order to resolve the queries  a survey of rfid data processing 367 sequence scan and construction  ssc   while sequence scan and construction are technically dierent operators  they are always used together  the corresponding component is referred to as ssc  when a query contains the seq construct in the language  all the positive components of the seq specication are handled by the sequence scan and construction operators  thus  a subsequence of the original specication is handled by this pair of constructs  thus  the function of the ssc is to transform a stream of events into a stream of event sequences  each of which represents a unique match of specied ssc sub-sequence type  selection  this is the commonly used operator in relational query processing  in this case  this operator is used to lter each event sequence by applying dierent predicates  window  the window operator imposes the constraint of the within clause  for each event sequence  it checks if the temporal dierence between the rst and last events is less than the specied window t  negation  the negation operator handles the negative components of a seq construct which have been ignored by ssc  transformation  this operator converts each event sequence to a composite event by concatenating attributes of all the events in the sequence  another recent method for event processing with rfid data has been proposed in  9   this method has the ability to query dierent readers for data in order to make key real time inferences for events  in addition  methods have been designed to work with the code embedded in the rfid tags for event processing  the epc tags represents a string  in which dierent portions of the string correspond to dierent parts of the information about the product  therefore  any algorithm needs to be able to work eectively in terms of deciphering the importance of dierent portions of the string for event processing  the approach in  9  shows how to extend an sql-based query language in order to make it suitable for event processing in the context of rfid data  this can be an advantage in many scenarios  because users are often more familiar with sql-like languages  because of this  recent systems for event processing  19  have generally tried to work with extensions of the sql language for event processing  it has been observed  6  that stream event detection algorithms can be generally formulated as pattern matching algorithms over data streams  368 managing and mining sensor data many of the traditional database operators for stream processing can not eectively handle the detection of arbitrary event patterns  these techniques are quite eective for regular expression matching  though not quite as eective for pattern matching  the latter is much more important in the stream scenario  therefore  the work in  6  proposes a method for matching arbitrary patterns in data streams in order to perform event detection  this work proposes a formal query evaluation model  n f ab that combines a nite automaton with a match buer  this is used to create query evaluation plans that can be executed over event streams  one characteristic of this approach is that it uses storage sharing of all possible pattern matches as well as in automaton execution to produce these matches  this results in more ecient query execution  4.1 probabilistic event extraction it has been observed in  45  47  that there is an inherent ambiguity in the cleaning and determination of high level events of rfid data  since  the collection of rfid data is prone to errors  it is natural that such data is best represented by probabilistic databases as discussed in  17  31  77   the importance of using probabilistic representations for event extraction in pervasive computing applications has been discussed in depth in  25   though the approach discusses the design of an inference engine for event extraction  in the context of rfid data management applications  it is more critical to design a query processing engine for probabilistic event extraction  therefore  the work in  45  proposes a probabilistic event language peexl for dening probabilistic events  an implementation of the approach is proposed in a system called probabilistic event extractor  peex   a middleware layer on top of a relational database management system  rdbms   the idea is that uncertainty propagates as events are aggregated into higher level events  for example  a meeting event can be inferred from a sequence of entered-room events by dierent participants  however  if there is limited condence in the entered-room events  then the condence in the meeting events will also be lower  the work in  45  47  uses condence tables in order to track the condence of the dierent events and then aggregate these probabilities into higher level event probabilities with the use of the peexl language  another interesting probabilistic event processing system known as lahar has been proposed in  61   this approach uses a framework which is similar to the cayuga system  18  for event processing  except that it is focussed on querying probabilistic representations of the underlying data  a survey of rfid data processing 5  369 privacy and security issues with rfid data one challenge with the use of rfid technology is that the tags on the items can be tracked by sensor readers without the knowledge or consent of people carrying them  for example  the items bought in a store can be used in order to track people  as they move about in the world  this is particularly true for items such as shoes or clothing  this has lead to increasing privacy concerns about the large-scale use of such technology  24  43  51  57   for example  the consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering  caspian  protested against apparel manufacturer benetton for planning to attach rfid tags to their products  this lead to a boycott of those products in 2003  57  82   caspian similarly criticized tesco for conducting experimental trials of tags on a variety of its products  83  in 2005 an additional troubling aspect of the tags is that they contain no information about their read-history  while tags can be scanned by anyone without the consumers knowledge  there is also no way for the consumer to know that they have been scanned  the epc contains a serial number  which is unique to a particular instance of the product item  therefore  once a customer buys the product and carries it on their person  the product epc becomes a unique identier for the customer  which can be distinguished from a similar product bought by another customer  this information can be misused in a variety of ways  individuals carrying tagged products can be tracked with the use of covert readers placed at dierent locations  since the epc also contains manufacturer information  it can be used in order to order to obtain competitive information about customer preferences without their knowledge  when tagged items move from one individual to the other  the transactions between dierent individuals can be tracked  associations are often built up between tagged items and individuals in corporate information systems  as individuals move around with tagged items over time  when these items are discarded  such associations are typically not broken  if these items are then used for malicious or illegal purposes  then this can expose the individual to dierent kinds of liabilities with law enforcement  in addition to the personal privacy threats  a number of threats are possible with the use of rfid data at the corporate level  a particular area of concern is the tracking of rfid data for the purposes of corporate espionage  tagged objects in the supply chain make it easy 370 managing and mining sensor data for competitors to routinely gather information about the activities of a business  the use of rfid technology also has security consequences which go beyond simple privacy concerns  these are as follows  rfid technology is highly dependent on the use of radio signals which are easily jammed  this can open the system to a variety of infrastructure threats  it has recently been demonstrated  10   that rfid tags can be cloned to emit the same identication code as another tag  this opens the system to fraud  when the rfid tag is used for the purpose of sensitive tasks such as payment  this can also be used in order to make the function of an automobile immobilizer vulnerable to attack  we note that privacy issues for rfid data can arise both during data collection and during data management  once the rfid data has been captured  for the case of data collection  the information is typically stolen through eavesdropping on either the tag or the reader signal  in this case  since the privacy concerns arise from the design of the tag itself  many of the issues need to be addressed by enhancement and modication of the underlying tag  with either hardware or software solutions  or a combination of both  on the other hand  in the case of data management  the privacy issues relate to the access control of the underlying data  we will discuss some of the dierent methods for privacy preservation both during data collection and management in the following subsections  5.1 the kill command the auto-id center designed the kill command  which are intended to be executed at the point of sale  the kill command can be triggered by a signal  which explicitly disables the tag  63  64   if desired  a short 8-bit password can be included with the kill command  the tag is subsequently dead and no longer emits the epc  which is needed to identify it  however  the killing of a tag  can sometimes be an impractical solution in cases  where the tags have a utility beyond the point of sale  some examples are as follows  the tags are used for identication purposes in order to facilitate the repairs or returns for the underlying products  many smart appliances use the tags for other purposes  an example discussed in  24  discusses the smart refrigerator which uses a survey of rfid data processing 371 rfid tags in order to identify expired food  clearly  the killing of a tag at the point of sale would make this functionality useless  therefore  a number of methods have been proposed  which go beyond the kill command for the purposes of providing privacy protection  a slightly softer solution is to use a locking and unlocking mechanism for the tags  75   for example  the tags could be locked at the time of check out in the store  the tags can then be unlocked with a meta-id provided by the consumer  along with an associated pin  this approach has two primary disadvantages  one disadvantage is that the incorporation of smart technology makes the tag much more expensive  the second disadvantage is that it is impractical for consumers to manage meta-identiers and pins for all the dierent products that they may buy  5.2 cryptographic solutions a possible solution is to encrypt the code in a tag before transmission  however  such a solution may not be very eective  because this only protects the content of the tag  but not the ability to uniquely identify the tag  for example  the encoded tag is itself a kind of meta-tag  which can be used for the purposes of tracking  another solution is to embed dynamic encryption ability within the tag  such a solution  however  comes at a cost  because it requires the chip to have the ability to perform such an encryption computation  another solution which has recently been proposed  40  is to perform the cryptographic computations at the reader end itself  and store the resulting information in the tags  this solution of course requires careful modication of the reader-tag protocols  a number of cryptographic protocols for privacy protection of library rfid activity are discussed in  55   some of the cryptographic schemes  44  48  58  work with re-writable memory in the tags in order to increase security  the tags are encrypted  and the reader is able to decrypt them when they send them to the server  in order to determine the unique meta-information in the tag  the reader also has the capability to re-encrypt the tag with a dierent key and write it to its memory  so that the  encrypted  tag signal for an eavesdropper is dierent at dierent times  such a scheme provides additional protection because of repeated change in the encrypted representation of the tag  and prevents the eavesdropper from uniquely identifying the tag at dierent times  372 5.3 managing and mining sensor data blocker tags an interesting solution for making it dicult to read tags in an unauthorized way is the use of blocker tags  41  42   blocker tags exploit the collision properties of rfid transmission  which are inherent in this technology  the key idea is that when two rfid tags transmit distinct signals to a reader at the same time  a broadcast collision occurs  which prevents the reader from deciphering either response  such collisions are in fact very likely to occur during the normal operation of the rfid infrastructure  in order to handle this issue  rfid readers typically use anti-collision protocols  the purpose of blocker tags is to emit signals  or spam  which can defeat these anti-collision protocols  thereby causing the reader to stall  the idea is that blocker tags should be implemented in a way  that it will only spam unauthorized readers  thereby allowing the authorized readers to behave normally  typically the anti-collision protocols which are used are also referred to as singulation protocols  which allow the tag reader to systematically explore all the tags in a certain order with the use of a tree-walking protocol  which singles out all the tags for scanning in a specic order  this is achieved by treating the binary code on each tag in the form of a binary tree  where each node in the tree is considered a prex of the binary tree  the idea is that the reader has the capability to scan for tags containing only a particular prex  and ask all other tags to remain silent  tags which contain that particular prex  transmit their bit which comes just after that prex  the algorithm starts at the root of the tree  and scans the rst bit of the tags  in the event that both 0 and 1 is transmitted  then a collision will occur  which is detected  this means that both branches of the tree need to be explored  since there are tags which contain both a 0 and a 1 in the rst  clearly  a collision is quite likely to occur at the higher levels of the tree  on the other hand  if only a 0 is transmitted  then the left branch of the tree needs to be explored  otherwise  the right branch of the tree is explored  this process is used to recursively traverse the portion of the tree which is relevant to the rfid tags being scanned  this recursive traversal nally reaches the leaves of the tree  at which point  the tags are recorded uniquely by the reader  it is clear that for a 96-bit class 1 epc tag  the portion of the tree which is explored by the reader is an extremely tiny fraction of the 296 possible nodes in the tree  since the number of distinct tags being present would be much smaller than 296  in fact  the entire tree-size is too large to be explored by the tree-walking algorithm  the blocker tag takes advantage of this property and forces  malicious  readers to explore the full tree of size 2k  which would cause the a survey of rfid data processing 373 reader to stall  the idea is that for each query by the reader  the blocker tag always sends both and 0 and a 1 this means that the reader would have to recursively traverse the entire tree  an undesirable situation  which could cause the reader to stall  the blocker tag can be modied to block only those tags with certain prexes  a process which is referred to as selective blocking  for example  the blocker tag may respond to the reader only for those prexes which correspond to the left subtree of the root  this means that all rfids which start with a 0 are now protected or blocked from scanning  thus  by carefully assigning prexes to dierent products  it is possible to selectively block only certain kinds of products for the purposes of privacy protection  alternatively  it may be possible to reset the prex in a tag at check-out time  so as to move the tag from the unprotected zone to the protected zone  once it has been bought by the consumer  a blocker tag may either be carried by a consumer on their person  through active acquisition   or may be provided by a supermarket in a grocery bag  so as to prevent undesired scanning of the items bought by a consumer  once the items are removed from the bag  for example  when food items are placed in a refrigerator   the tags can become usable again  since they have been removed from the vicinity of the blocker tag  the main drawback of blocker tags is that they only provide an opt-out mechanism  in which tags are active by default  and consumers must take the step of acquiring blockers in order to protect their privacy  such opt-out mechanisms are very useful  when the tags only need to be blocked at certain times  places  or in the possession of certain people  we further note that a polite blocking protocol can be implemented  which allows the readers to query the blocker tags  which tells them the portions of the tree that they should not traverse  41   thus  the blocker tag is being polite to the reader in telling it  which portions of the tree it is blocking  the tree-walking protocol can then be modied in order to not query those portions of the tree which are being blocked  polite blocking is useful  when the environment may contain legitimate readers  which should not be made to inadvertently stall by the use of blocker tags  since authorized readers are likely to follow the proper protocol  they will not be aected by the blocker tag  furthermore  even if unauthorized readers use the proper protocol  they will be unable to access the tags of items with protected prexes  this is the entire purpose of blocking  the blocking approach can be considered a kind of passive jamming  and can be used both for privacy protection or for malicious purposes  when used for malicious purposes  it can be considered equivalent to a 374 managing and mining sensor data denial of service attack  which prevents readers from performing their normal function by jamming them  5.4 other privacy and security-protection methods a number of privacy-protection mechanisms rely on the fact that the eavesdroppers are more likely to be at some distance from the tag  in this context  it was inferred by  75  that the greater threat to privacy arises from the eavesdropping of signals sent from the reader  which can be detected much further away   rather than reading the tag itself  which can be done only at a much closer distance   in fact  the ids being read by the tree-walking protocol can be inferred merely by listening to the signals being broadcast by the reader  therefore  it has been proposed in  75  to encrypt the signals being sent by the reader in order to prevent privacy attacks by eavesdropping of reader signals  a recent approach proposed in  21  makes the observation that the legitimate readers are likely to be much closer to rfid tags  as compared to unauthorized readers which attempt to surreptitiously scan items  it is possible for a tag to detect the strength of the scanning signal  and change its behavior depending upon the distance  for closer readers  the full signal is transmitted  whereas for readers which are further away  only the information about the type of product is transmitted  a variety of other methods are available to make rfid tags smarter for the purposes of privacy protection  for example  it is possible to modify rfid tags to cycle through a set of pseudonyms rather than emit a unique serial number  40   thus  the tag cycles through a set of k pseudonyms and emits them sequentially  this makes it more dicult for an attacker to identify the tags  because they may only be able to scan dierent pseudonyms of the tags at dierent times  of course  if the attacker is aware of the method being used in order to mask the tag  they may try to scan the tag over a longer period of time  in order to learn all the pseudonyms associated with the tag  this process can be made more dicult for an attacker by increasing the time it takes for the tag to switch from one pseudonym to another  of course  the ability to modify the data in the rfid tags is also a security threat  when it is done by an adversary  therefore  a natural solution is to password-protect the memory in the rfid tag  this is a challenge from an energy consumption perspective  since all cryptographic algorithms require a large amount of energy  and it would require an onboard battery  active tag  for enablement  in this context  a survey of rfid data processing 375 a number of methods  which have low energy requirements for these cryptographic solutions have been proposed recently  12  20   5.5 privacy issues in data management in previous subsections  we addressed the privacy issues which arise as a result of eavesdropping on the tag or the reader  in this subsection  we will discuss the privacy issues which arise from the data management issues of the collected data  the general methods for privacy-preservation  such as k-anonymity  -diversity  t-closeness etc  are also applicable to the data which is captured using rfid technology  3   the general goal of these methods is to reduce the delity of the captured data  so that aggregate inferences can still be derived from it  without compromising privacy  a number of interesting challenges for privacy arise  when both people and objects are tagged  and the same people have access to the captured rfid data  such a scenario arises in the context of an rfid ecosystem constructed at the university of washington  49  74   the most restrictive view to privacy would be one in which users only have access to their own data  while this assures complete privacy of a user  it also unnecessarily curtails the useful insights which one can obtain from such data  this is because events which occurred in the proximity of a given user at a given time should be accessible to the user  even if they do not directly relate to the user themselves  this is because such events could be observed by that user by virtue of their physical presence  it has been observed in  49  that a natural access control policy to use in such a scenario is one in which the data to which a user can gain access is that which corresponds to events which occurred at times and places when and where the user was physically present  this policy is also referred to as physical access control  pac  in  49   in a sense  such a policy provides a database view which augments peoples memory of objects  places and people  it also naturally models the boundaries of people in everyday life  in addition  a user can also specify rules which can relax or restrict the access to data which concerns them  this provides a certain level of personal choice and exibility in the privacypreservation process  the work in  60  further implements the broad principles of the pac policy by designing a rule-based system  which can infer which information to release for a particular user  the system starts from pac  and then uses a number of reasoning rules in order to make careful decisions about access control  376 6 managing and mining sensor data conclusions and summary while rfid is a relatively old technology  its use for large scale applications has proliferated in recent years  this is because of technological advances in manufacturing  which have made the tags smaller and cheaper  the ability to manufacture a tag at less than 5 cents  per tag  has allowed their widespread use in a cost eective way  rfid data brings numerous challenges with it for the purposes of mining and analysis  rfid data is inherently noisy and redundant because of missed tag readings  or multiple readings of the same tag from dierent readers  therefore  techniques need to be designed in order to make the process of reading more robust and reduce the redundancy in the underlying data  the massive volume of the rfid data also makes the process of warehousing and querying the rfid data much more challenging  therefore methods need to be designed in order to represent the rfid warehouse in terms of the aggregated views of rfid items which typically move together  these aggregated views greatly improve the eciency of data storage and querying  rfid data can be useful in detecting important semantic events from the underlying data streams  the existing work in active databases and sensor stream event detection can be further extended in a variety of ways to make it suitable to the rfid scenario  for example  methods have recently been designed for event processing in uncertain rfid data streams  rfid data naturally leads to a number of privacy challenges  because of the association of people with tags  and the likelihood of monitoring peoples location with such tags  the privacy issues with rfid data arise both during data collection and management  a number of methods such as the kill command  cryptographic protocols  and blocker tags have been designed for privacy protection during data collection  in addition  a number of methods for physical access control have been developed for preserving personal privacy during data management  references  1  r adaikkalavan  s chakravarthy  snoopib  interval-based event
