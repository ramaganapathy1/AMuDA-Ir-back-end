localization solutions has grown exponentially  and a wide variety of different technologies and approaches are being explored  unfortunately  there is currently no established standardized evaluation method for comparing their performance  as a result  each solution is evaluated in a different environment using proprietary evaluation metrics  consequently  it is currently extremely hard to objectively compare the performance of multiple localization solutions with each other  to address the problem  we present the evarilos benchmarking platform  which enables automated evaluation and comparison of multiple solutions in different environments using multiple evaluation metrics  we propose a testbed-independent benchmarking platform  combined with multiple testbed-dependent plugins for executing experiments and storing performance results  the platform implements the standardized evaluation method described in the evarilos benchmarking handbook  which is aligned with the upcoming iso/iec 18305 standard test and evaluation of localization and tracking systems  the platform and plug-ins can be used in real time on existing wireless testbed facilities  while also supporting a remote offline evaluation method using precollected data traces  using these facilities  and analyzing and comparing the performance of three different localization solutions  we demonstrate the need for objective evaluation methods that consider multiple evaluation criteria in different environments  introduction this article addresses one of the major problems of indoor localization research  the lack of comparability between existing localization solutions  due to the fact that most of them have been evaluated under individual  thus not comparable and not repeatable  conditions  this situation is partially the result of the complexity required for the evaluation of an indoor localization solution  which requires technical expertise to efficiently set up large-scale experiments  control the exper 0163-6804/15/ $ 25.00 2015 ieee imental environment  gather the necessary performance data  and calculate the output metrics using standardized methods  all these steps are time consuming  and more theoretically inclined researchers typically lack the necessary technical skills to perform these steps efficiently and accurately  we address these deficiencies by providing a platform that allows simple evaluation of indoor localization solutions  the main contributions of the presented article are as follows  we describe a generic benchmarking platform that implements the standardized evaluation method described in the evarilos benchmarking handbook  ebh   and is aligned with the upcoming international organization for standardization/international electrotechnical commission  iso/iec  18305 standard test and evaluation of localization and tracking systems  we further describe plug-ins that are available for instantiating the components of the evarilos benchmarking platform on multiple future internet research and experimentation  fire  facilities.1 finally  we provide open datasets that help in simplifying the process of benchmarking and evaluation of indoor localization solutions  the rest of this article is structured as follows  the next section provides an overview of the related work  then the evarilos benchmarking platform  ebp  is explained in detail  the integration of the ebp in a wireless test facility and the public datasets are then discussed  we then demonstrate the usage of the ebp in an experimental validation of multiple rf-based indoor localization solutions  finally  we conclude the work  related work as the number of indoor localization solutions is growing  a more thorough procedure for evaluating and comparing them is necessary  as already observed in other fields  1   a well defined objective evaluation methodology needs to take into consideration a wide range of metrics  some metrics are important from a theoretical point of view  and are well suited for analyzing and improving proposed algorithms  whereas others ieee communications magazine september 2015 vanhaute_layout.qxp_author layout 9/3/15 5:43 pm page 127 focus on the performance of end solutions  and are more important for industry and end users  if only accuracy is taken into account  the results can give a distorted view  such considerations have motivated m ficco et al   2  to evaluate indoor localization solutions with respect to deployment metrics  they compare and calibrate the deployment and usage of access points  aps   and show that the quality of the radiomap has a direct influence on the accuracy  furthermore  hui liu et al  state in  3  that precision  complexity  scalability  robustness  and cost should be included if a comprehensive performance analysis is required  additionally  they also recognize the lack of an objective methodology for the evaluation of indoor localization solutions  motivated by these circumstances  a number of organizations are trying to develop comprehensive standardized evaluation approaches for indoor localization solutions  evarilos project  in the scope of the fp7 evarilos project  focused on objective evaluation of rf-based indoor localization solutions  the ebh  4  has been published  the handbook describes a set of evaluation metrics that are important for the evaluation of indoor localization  including different notions of accuracy  functional metrics such as response delays  and deployment metrics such as setup time and required infrastructure  furthermore  the handbook contains a set of scenarios that describe how to adequately evaluate an indoor localization solution  the project is also the first one to systematically address the effect of interference on indoor localization solutions  although interference is expected to be present at most sites where these solutions are deployed  the ebh includes a wide range of evaluation metrics  including functional metrics  such as response delays  and deployment metrics  such as setup time and required infrastructure  iso  recently  the iso and iec established a joint technical committee  iso/iec jtc 1  focused on proposing a new iso/iec 18305 standard  test and evaluation of localization and tracking systems.2 current drafts include evaluation methodologies for a single technology  e.g  bluetooth   as well as methodologies for the evaluation of full localization solutions  which is in line with the methodology proposed in the evarilos project  while this effort is more general in that it also pertains to a wide range of non-rf-based technologies such as motion sensors  thus far it does not include nonaccuracy-related metrics such as ease of use or energy consumption  at the time of writing  none of the drafts were publicly available  evaal  until now  the only attempts at direct comparison of different indoor localization solutions were indoor localization competitions  one popular series of indoor localization competitions has been organized by microsoft as part of the information processing in sensor networks  ipsn  conference  during the 2014 edition of the competition  5   22 different indoor localization solutions were evaluated  organized in two categories  infrastructure-free and infrastructure ieee communications magazine september 2015 based   the evaluation process uses only a single metric  average localization error across 20 test points  the errors are measured manually using a handheld laser distance meter  in 2015  the evaluation process for the 23 competing solutions took more than one day  in 2014 we shadowed the official evaluation process using the ebp presented in this article  and demonstrated the viability and the benefits of a full automation of this process  the evaluating aal systems through competitive benchmarking  evaal  project3 uses a set of metrics as part of the evaluation process for its competition series  in addition to the accuracy of indoor localization  usability metrics are defined such as installation complexity  user acceptance  availability  and interoperability with aal systems  the evaluation process is not automated  and involves deploying physical devices in the environment of interest  most scientific papers evaluate the solution they propose in an easily accessible environment in the development area of the authors  typically  these are office environments with brick walls  6  7   since evaluation is rather time consuming  most localization solutions are evaluated only in a single environment  both the evarilos project and iso/iec jtc 1 refer to the fact that this evaluation is not representative for other environments  therefore  our platform offers developers the possibility to evaluate their localization solutions using input datasets collected in multiple environments  an office environment with brick walls  an office environment with plywood walls  and finally  an industrial-like openspace environment  since the accuracy strongly depends on the used evaluation points  for example  points near a wall vs in the middle of a room or in an open space  our public datasets contain data measured at a wide range of measurement points  our platform offers developers the possibility to evaluate their localization solutions using input datasets collected in multiple environments  an office environment with brick walls  an office environment with plywood walls  and finally  an industriallike open-space environment  evarilos benchmarking platform this section describes the ebp  4 the ebp has been created to address the fact that  although numerous experimental testbed facilities are available  8  9   evaluating the performance of a localization solution under controlled conditions using standardized performance metrics has proven to be very complicated  in particular for researchers who have limited experience with experimental research  the ebp addresses this issue by providing an open software solution that implements user friendly methods to support the full performance evaluation cycle  the developed software components are independent of any experimental facilities and use open source principles  allowing researchers to download and modify any of the components  an overview of the ebp architecture is shown in fig  1 the rectangles  represent components that are available as web services  these components run on a cloud platform where they can be accessed remotely or downloaded to be modified and/or run locally  the parallelograms  represent data struc 2 http  //www.iso.org 3 http  //evaal.aaloa.org 4 http  //ebp.evarilos.eu/ 127

deploymentsite 128 tures that are used to exchange data between the web services  the flags  represent the tools that can be used to analyze and visualize the different steps of the process  the architecture consists of a set of components that  when used sequentially  implement a workflow which represents three experimentation steps  a summary can be found below  while in the next subsections each step is discussed in detail  pre-experimentation phase  during a preexperimentation phase  users can download environment-specific training datasets from public repositories  these datasets are typically used for training the localization solution  experimentation phase  in the experimentation phase  all the components required for the experimentation are orchestrated  and the experiments are executed  the platform offers the possibility for automated generation of experiment configurations  including specifications of the used evaluation points  the interference patterns that will be generated  and so on  based on these descriptions  experiment executables are created using testbed-specific tools with the control and management framework  omf  ,5 which is used in many recent wireless testbeds,6 and are automatically executed  note that this step can be omitted if the next step utilizes precollected input  e.g  wifi beacons  for a localization solution  sut  finally  the environmental rf data is fed to the system under test  sut   either in real-time or using precollected measurements  depending on the experiment configuration  the estimated locations are stored together with additional performance metrics such as the response delay  it is also possible to combine results from multiple experiments to observe how certain evaluation metrics evolve  training phase the training phase offers experimenters the possibility to train their localization solutions based on measurements that are performed in advance on a representative location  the measurements currently offered represent raw data that can be used as input into an rf-based indoor localization solution  such as received signal strength indicator  rssi   link quality indicator  lqi   or time of arrival  toa   measurements for training purposes are captured in an area that is representative for the experimentation phase  typically  the data is captured in the same environment where the sut will be evaluated  to prevent aliasing problems  the training data should not exactly correspond to the data that is used during the evaluation phase  otherwise  the performance evaluation of step 2 of the evaluation process will be biased  to this end  users can use data that is  captured at a different time captured using devices from a different manufacturer captured at evaluation points other than the one used during the performance evaluation ieee communications magazine september 2015 vanhaute_layout.qxp_author layout 9/3/15 5:43 pm page 129 hardware software system under test

used to analyze and rank the outcome of any localization solution  figure 2 deployment of the ebp  the platform offers researchers a database to access previously measured environmental information relevant for their localization solution  users can either download the data directly from the evarilos data repository or can access an evarilos application programming interface  api  that encapsulates the data and can serve the data at a finer granularity  experimentation phase the experimentation phase offers experimenters the possibility to define setups for raw rf data collection or full localization experiments in fire facilities  as well as an interface for automatic execution  the user will start with an experiment definition  fig  1   the role of the experiment definition component is to configure all aspects of the experiment that will be used to evaluate a sut  to this end  the experiment definition component requires the following input  the experiment specification  e.g  which nodes will be used as anchor points  when will the experiment be scheduled  which binary files to use   the evaluation points  at which locations is a sut evaluated   and the type of  artificial  interference that should be generated  to assist with this process  a fully automated web service is available  where users can select among different preconfigured options  of course  it is possible to modify any of the default settings to adjust the experiment behavior  this information is also stored in a standardized data format  next  the experiment creation component is executed  which is a fully automated step  whereby the testbed-independent information is translated into testbed-dependent executables using the appropriate plug-ins  the final step is the actual execution of an experiment  in this step  the executables are executed on the corresponding testbed  and the result of the execution is stored in an appropriate data structure together with additional metadata  describing a whole experiment in detail  the result of the execution ieee communications magazine september 2015 is raw data  such as wifi or ieee 802.15.4 beacon information  which is collected by a sut at different locations in an environment  post-processing phase in this step the obtained raw data traces can be fed to the evaluated sut  and location estimates can be produced  furthermore  the metrics characterizing the performance of a sut can be calculated  the experiment results are stored in an appropriate data structure  which consists of a set of ground truths and estimates for different measurement locations and a set of metrics characterizing the performance of a sut for a given experiment  experiment results from multiple experiments can be combined to observe how certain evaluation metrics evolve  for example  for different scenarios or different parametrization of a sut  these results are stored in a secondary metrics data structure  for comparability purposes  a final score can be assigned to the performance of each sut  this score is an abstraction of the performance of a sut in a specific environment and necessarily hides many intrinsic trade-offs  finally  it is worth mentioning that the full postprocessing phase can also be applied to location estimates from non-ebp-compliant solutions  as long as the experiment results are provided in the correct data format  the same tools can be used to analyze and rank the outcome of any localization solution  integration of ebp in wireless experimentation facilities the ebp is designed to simplify the evaluation of rf-based localization solutions  the components of the platform can be used as is by utilizing precollected data traces as input  however  as already mentioned  the platform components can also be used to facilitate the evaluation of 129 vanhaute_layout.qxp_author layout 9/3/15 5:43 pm page 130 figure 3 two examples of the testbeds  w-ilab.t i and ii  where experiments can be executed  7 http  //www.crewproject.eu/ 130 localization solutions in new environments  the available deployment options for indoor localization benchmarking are presented in fig  2 three main components can be identified  the bottom layer represents a wireless experimentation facility or testbed  the testbed-specific tools are installed on a server in a given test facility  the ebp includes services that facilitate testbed-independent definition of experimentation and the evaluation of localization solutions  finally  the upper layer represents a sut  which can include both hardware and/or software components  as mentioned  the ebp is integrated in existing fire facilities  this integration is part of the experiment execution component illustrated in fig  1 automatic conversion from experiment descriptions to testbed-dependent scripts is supported  thereby integrating and simplifying the complex steps that otherwise need to be taken for objective experimentation  building on top of the crew cognitive radio testbeds,7 the infrastructure leverages a robotic mobility platform  which serves as a reference localization system and can transport the localized device in an autonomous and repeatable manner  in addition  the platform uses the capabilities of the crew testbed infrastructure to generate typical interference scenarios in a reproducible manner  this further improves benchmarking of indoor localization solutions by testing the performance of a sut under realistic and repeatable interference conditions  the interaction between a sut and the ebp is designed to be as simple as possible  at most two rest interfaces  10  11  are required  depending on the requirements of an experiment  one interface provides location estimates and ground truth information to the ebp  and the other stores the raw data from a sut or uses the precollected raw data as input to a sut  during an experiment  the ebp can issue a request for the location estimate from a sut through the first rest interface  as such  the minimum requirement for a sut to comply with the ebp is to provide the location estimate over http upon request  the ebp can also request the real-time environmental data   rssi values  toa  etc   from a sut  which is then stored through a second rest interface  this data can be collected and at a later time be offered to future experimenters as an open data set  this architecture allows experimenters to choose among different utilization options  option 1  the evaluation of a localization algorithm using precollected raw data traces that can be used as input to a sut  in this scenario  the localization algorithms can be evaluated remotely using the ebp  option 2  the evaluation of a localization solution using software running on an existing wireless testbed  in this scenario  the localization algorithms can run on local hardware that is available at the experimentation facilities  option 3  the evaluation of localization hardware using a testbed  in this scenario  experimenters can install custom hardware at the experimentation facility while still using the ebp for the evaluation of their solution  one of the major advantages of the ebp is that all three approaches make use of the same common components  the feasibility of these options has been demonstrated through the evarilos open challenge  12   as well as during the microsoft indoor localization competition  ipsn 2014   5   public datasets one of the features of the ebp is the capability to reuse previously collected rf data for offline evaluation of rf-based indoor localization solutions  this feature addresses one of the important challenges for the indoor localization research community  the complex and expensive process of obtaining relevant measurements of rf features from multiple environments  the ebp offers a wide range of available precollected rf data sources through its user interface  however  for those researchers who prefer to download full annotated datasets  the ebp also offers the possibility to download the datasets for research purposes  two types of datasets are currently available  raw rf traces and performance information  raw rf traces environmental rf data can be used as a basis for either training an algorithm  e.g  by creating propagation models  or offline evaluation of a sut  the ebp makes available the measured raw rf traces from multiple environments  including a plywood office environment  wilab.t i  8    a brick office environment  twist  13    an industrial-like environment  w-ilab.t ii  8    a hospital environment  and an underground mine  a view of w-ilab.t i and ii is available in fig  3 the details about the structure of the raw rf data  exact descriptions of the currently available datasets  and an overview of the services available for using the raw rf data for the evaluation of rf-based indoor localization algorithms can be found in  14   to evaluate a solution for a wide range of conditions  the raw rf traces contain significantly more data than would be used in a typical operational environment  the datasets are rich in terms of number of collected samples per evaluation point  over 1000 samples per evaluation point   the captured data types  including wifi beacons  sensor rssi  and sensor time-offlight information   the used configuration set ieee communications magazine september 2015 vanhaute_layout.qxp_author layout 9/3/15 5:43 pm page 131 performance information the ebp gives a ranked overview of evaluated solutions on its web page  however  these performance indicators necessarily hide a number of low-level statistics  researchers interested in also evaluating the temporal or spatial behavior of different solutions can analyze the performance datasets  ebp makes available the results from its own localization solutions  as well as of those solutions that participated in the evarilos open challenge  12   each of these datasets also has its associated experiment configuration settings  allowing detailed analysis not only of the performance but also of the conditions in which the solutions were evaluated  experimental validation in  14  we illustrate the benefits of leveraging the presented platform for the evaluation of rfbased indoor localization  in terms of time and complexity of usage  in comparison to using an infrastructure or performing a manual evaluation  in the following we demonstrate the need for a standardized evaluation method by showing that the performance of localization solutions depends strongly on its parametrization and can only be done objectively by considering multiple evaluation metrics  three indoor localization solutions in order to develop  test  and optimize our platform  three different types of indoor localization solutions were used as suts  the basic concept behind the first localization solution  15  is the following  measurements are performed by requesting a stationary node to transmit packets to the testbed nodes that then reply with a hardware acknowledgment  ack   the initiating node measures the time between transmission of the packet and reception of the ack  and stores the rssi values associated with the ack  these measurements are then processed using spray  a particle-filter-based platform  15   the basic idea of the tof ranging is to estimate the distance between two nodes by measuring the propagation time  which is linearly correlated to the distance when the nodes are in the line of sight  los   a second solution  16  is based on fingerprinting  fingerprinting methods for indoor ieee communications magazine september 2015 localization error cdf  twist  proximity  1.0 0.8 probability tings  multiple frequencies  multiple transmission powers   and the used anchor points  data is collected from up to 60 anchor points per evaluation point   this richness of the dataset makes the data relevant for a wide range of interested researchers and allows investigation of how changing any of these parameters influences the performance of the solution  transforming the over-dimensioned dataset into a set that is more sparse  and more realistic from an operational point of view  can easily be done by removing any unnecessary information  sub-sampling   in addition  the available environment data is annotated with metadata describing the exact conditions in which the data was captured  this metadata describes characteristics including the used hardware  type of collected raw data  timestamps  measurement frequency  environment description  and so on  0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 tx power 3 tx power 7 tx power 19 tx power 31 0 2 4 6 localization error  m  8 10 figure 4 cdfs for the hybrid solution in the twist testbed  localization are generally divided in two phases  the first phase is called training or offline phase  in this phase  the localization area is divided in a certain number of cells  each cell is scanned a certain number of times for different signal properties  and using a methodology for processing the received data  a representative fingerprint of each cell is created  using the obtained training fingerprints  the training database is created and stored on a localization server  in the second phase  known as the runtime or online phase  a number of scans of the environment are created using the users device  from the scanned data  using the same predefined data processing methodology  a runtime fingerprint is created and sent to the localization server  at the servers side  the runtime fingerprint is compared to the training dataset using a matching method  the training fingerprint with the most similarities to the runtime fingerprint is reported as the estimated position  a third localization solution  17  that has been implemented and evaluated is a hybrid combination range-based and range-free algorithm  it includes a range-based location estimator based on weighted rssi values  each rssi value can be matched with a certain distance  the proposed algorithm in  17  not only uses the rssi values to measure the distance between a fixed node and a mobile node  but also the distance between fixed nodes  these values function as weight factors for the distance calculation between the fixed and mobile nodes  once the distances are known  triangulation can be applied in order to determine the final position of the person/object that needs to be localized  this approach is combined with a range-free algorithm  which does not take rssi-values into account  if a mobile sensor node has a range of 10 m  a fixed node can only receive its messages if the mobile node is maximum 10 m away  this is the only information that is used to calculate the position of a mobile node  for this approach  131 vanhaute_layout.qxp_author layout 9/3/15 5:43 pm page 132 it is important that the transmission power is well configured  if the power is too low  the mobile node could be out of range between two fixed nodes  on the other hand  if the power is too high  too many fixed nodes will receive the beacon  and a wrong estimation could be made  analysis of a single solution an important feature of the ebp is its capability to streamline the process of obtaining better insight on the evaluated localization solution  every solution contains a set of adjustable parameters  which can considerably influence the overall performance  implying that optimizing this set of parameters can be a hard task  therefore  the ebp can easily compare the same solution using multiple values of a single parameter  this can be demonstrated with an example  the hybrid solution  17  described in the section above states that the transmission power is an important value that needs to be configured well in order to receive acceptable results  therefore  the solution was evaluated using the ebp using multiple transmission powers  the outcome of which is shown using a cumulative distribution function  cdf   fig  4  and a table with multiple metrics  table 1   based on these results  it is clear that this solution obtains the lowest average error when the transmission power equals three  but it also illustrates inherent trade-offs that are present in the solution  suppose the response time is the most important criteria ; then a transmission power of 31 would be the best option  this example illustrates the advantages of the ebp for fast and efficient identification of an optimal operating point depending on adjustable parameters  and demonstrates the need for considering multiple metrics to identify trade-offs  comparison between multiple solutions table 2 compares the performance of three different solutions evaluated using the ebp by considering multiple evaluation criteria  by utilizing the same evaluation points  objective comparisons are possible  again  the results illustrate the presence of trade-offs that can only be observed by comparing multiple metrics  more specifically  it demonstrates that the approach taken in most current scientific papers  wherein point accuracy is considered as the only relevant metric  fails to take into account the associated costs in response time and energy consumption  metric tx 3 tx 7 tx 19 tx 31 average error  m  4.63 7.08 6.93 8.31 min  error  m

proliferation of rf-based indoor localization solutions raises the need for testing systems that enable objective evaluation of their functional and non-functional properties  although a significant number of localization solutions are available  different approaches are used for the evaluation of these solutions in terms of used performance metrics and evaluation methodology  this article tries to address these shortcomings by providing tools for evaluating and comparing localization solutions using standardized evaluation methods  as described in the ebh  we introduce a testbed-independent benchmarking platform for automatized benchmarking of rf-based indoor localization solutions  using a well defined interface  the infrastructure obtains location estimates from the sut  which are subsequently processed in a dedicated metrics computation engine  the components can be accessed through web services that are available for external users or can be downloaded for custom modifications  the benchmarking platform has proven to be useful for locations where no testbed facilities are available  multiple components of the platform were extensively used during the microsoft indoor localization competition  ipsn 2014  as well as the evarilos open challenge  in these events  the components of the benchmarking platform improve the time efficiency and ease of use of the experiments  and also resulted in more objective comparability  finally  to accommodate the need for wider accessibility of experimental data  open datasets are provided  these datasets include both
