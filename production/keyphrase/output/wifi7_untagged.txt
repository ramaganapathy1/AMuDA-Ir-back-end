work is properly cited  the advances in localization based technologies and the increasing importance of ubiquitous computing and context-dependent information have led to a growing business interest in location-based applications and services  today  most application requirements are locating or real-time tracking of physical belongings inside buildings accurately ; thus  the demand for indoor localization services has become a key prerequisite in some markets  moreover  indoor localization technologies address the inadequacy of global positioning system inside a closed environment  like buildings  based on this  though  this paper aims to provide the reader with a review of the recent advances in wireless indoor localization techniques and system to deliver a better understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and motivate new research efforts in this promising field  for this purpose  existing wireless localization position system and location estimation schemes are reviewed  as we also compare the related techniques and systems along with a conclusion and future trends  1 introduction location based services  lbss   1  are a significant permissive technology and becoming a vital part of life  in this era  especially in wireless communication networks  lbs broadly exists from the short-range communication to the long-range telecommunication networks  lbs refers to the applications that depend on a users location to provide services in various categories including navigation  tracking  healthcare  and billing  however  its demand is increasing with new ideas with the advances in the mobile phone market  the core of the lbss is positioning technologies to find the motion activity of the mobile client  after detection  we pass these statistics to the mobile client on the move at the right time and the right location  so  the positioning technologies have a major influence on the performance  reliability  and privacy of lbss  systems  and applications  2   the basic components of lbs are software application  provided by the provider   communication network  mobile network   a content provider  a positioning device  and the end users mobile device  there are several ways to find the location of a mobile client indoors and outdoors  the most popular technology outdoors is global positioning system  gps   1   location finding refers to a process of obtaining location information of a mobile client  mc  with respect to a set of reference positions within a predefined space  in the literature  many terms are used for location finding like position location  geolocation  location sensing  or localization  3   position system is a system arranged in such a way to find or estimate the location of an object  the aims of this paper are to provide the reader with fingerprinting based wireless indoor localization techniques and systems for indoor applications  the authors hope that this paper will benefit researchers working in this field  users  and developers in terms of using these systems and will help them identify the potential research shortcoming and future application products in this emerging area  1.1 indoor versus outdoor positioning  positioning system can be categorized depending on the target environment as either indoor  outdoor  or mixed type  for localization in an outdoor environment  global navigation satellite systems  gnss  such as gps have been used in a wide range 2 of applications including tracking and asset management systems ; transport navigation and guidance ; synchronization of telecommunications networks ; geodetic survey  gps works extremely well in outdoor positioning  unfortunately  gps does not perform well in urban canyons  close to walls  buildings  trees  indoors  and in underground environments as the signal from the gps satellites is too weak to come across most buildings thus making gps ineffective for indoor localization  4   indoor positioning  5  can be defined as any system that provides a precise position inside of a closed structure  such as a shopping mall  hospitals  airport  a subway  and university campuses  by the complex nature of indoor environments  the development of an indoor localization technique is always associated with a set of challenges like smaller dimensions  high none line of sight  nlos   influence of obstacles like walls  equipment  movement of human beings  doors  and other factors  multipath effect signals are reflected and attenuated by walls and furniture and noise interference  6   these challenges result mainly from the influence of obstacles on the propagation of electromagnetic waves  for getting good and accurate results  a positioning system must be able to handle these problems  beside this  higher accuracy is also required indoors to locate a user at least in the right room  one of the important aspects indoors is indoor signal property characteristics  a signal strength pattern around an access point interference is shown in figure 1 some of the current indoor navigation technologies are listed in figure 2 journal of computer networks and communications less signal strength high signal strength figure 1  signal strength pattern  satellite based navigation inertial navigation system ins indoor navigation technologies sound based navigation optical based navigation electromagnetic wave based navigation magnetic based navigation infrastructure system based navigation 2 performance metrics figure 2  indoor navigation technologies  the performance criteria associated with localization systems can be classified into the following areas  2.1 accuracy  accuracy  or location error  of a system is the important user requirement of positioning systems  accuracy can be reported as an error distance between the estimated location and the actual mobile location  sometimes  accuracy is also called the area of uncertainty ; that is  the higher the accuracy is  the better the system is  2.2 responsiveness  the responsiveness determines how quickly the location estimate of a moving target is updated  2.3 coverage  the problem of determining the network coverage for a designated area is important when evaluating the effectiveness of a positioning system  coverage is closely related to accuracy  coverage can be categorized as local coverage  scalable coverage  and global coverage  local coverage is a small well-defined  limited area which is not extendable  e.g  a single room or building   in this case  the coverage size is specified  e.g   m    m2   or  m3    scalable coverage means systems with the ability to increase the area by adding hardware  and global coverage means system performance worldwide or within the desired/specified area  2.4 adaptiveness  environmental influence changes may affect the localization system performance  the ability of the localization system to cope with these changes is called its adaptiveness  a system that is able to adapt to environmental changes can provide better localization accuracy than systems that can not adapt  an adaptive system can also prevent the need for repeated calibration  2.5 scalability  scalability is a desirable property in almost any system that suggests how well the system performs when it operates with a larger number of location requests and a larger coverage  poor scalability can result in poor system performance  necessitating the reengineering or duplication of systems  a scalable positioning system should be able to handle large numbers of tags without unnecessary strain  2.6 cost and complexity  the cost gained from a positioning system can arise from the cost of extra infrastructure  additional bandwidth  money  lifetime  weight  energy  and nature of deployed technology  the cost may include installation and survey time during the deployment period  if a positioning system can reuse an existing communication infrastructure  some part of infrastructure  equipment  and bandwidth can be saved  the complexity of the signal processing and algorithms used to estimate the location is another issue that needs to be balanced with the performance of positioning journal of computer networks and communications 3 systems  tradeoffs between the system complexity and the accuracy affect the overall cost of the system  location detection 3 location detection techniques and location algorithms several different methods are used for location techniques and algorithms in wireless based localization  location detection techniques can be divided into three general categories  proximity  triangulation and scene analysis as shown in figure 3  3.1 proximity detection  connectivity based positioning   proximity detection or connectivity based is one of the simplest positioning methods to implement  it provides symbolic relative location information  the position of mobile client is determined by cell of origin  coo  method with known position and limited range  7   when more than one beacon detects the mobile target  it simply forwards the position nearest where the strongest signal is received  the accuracy of coo relates to the density of beacon point deployment and signal range  this method is implemented with several wireless positioning technologies  in particular  the system running infrared radiation  ir   radio frequency identification  rfid  gsm  cell-id   bluetooth  and custom radio devices  3   3.2 triangulation  triangulation uses the geometric properties of triangles to determine the target location  it has two derivations  lateration and angulation  techniques based on the measurement of the propagation-time system  e.g  toa  rtof  and tdoa  and rss-based and received signal phase methods are called lateration technique  8  9   the aoa estimation technique is also called an angulation technique  proximity detection triangulation direction based angle based method scene analysis distance based time based methods signal property based method figure 3  location detection based classification  245 140 100 localization figure 4  angle-of-arrival positioning method  3.2.1 angle based method 3.2.2 time based methods angle of arrival  aoa  /angulation  the angle of arrival  aoa  technique determines the angle of arrival of the mobile signal coming from a known location at which it is received at multiple base stations  3   to estimate position in a 2d dimension plane  aoa approach requires only two beacons  to improve accuracy  three beacons or more are used for location estimation  triangulation   for finding direction  it requires highly directional antennas or antenna arrays  geometric relationships can then be used to estimate the location of the intersection of two lines of bearing  lobs  from the known reference points as shown in figure 4 aoa-based techniques have their limitations  aoa requires additional antennas with the capacity to measure the angles which increase the cost of the aoa system implementation  in indoor environments  aoa-based methods are affected by multipath and nlos propagation of signals  along with reflections from walls and other objects  so it is not good for indoor implementation  due to these factors  it can significantly change the direction of signal arrival and thus degrade the accuracy of an indoor aoa-based positioning system  10   lateration/trilateration/multilateration  all three terms  lateration/trilateration/multilateration  refer to a position determined from distance measurements  lateration or trilateration determines the position of an object by measuring its distance from multiple reference points  thus  it is also called range measurement technique  in trilateration  the tri says that at least three fixed points are necessary to determine a position  techniques based on the measurement of the propagation-time system  e.g  toa  rtof  and tdoa  and rss-based and received signal phase methods are called lateration techniques  5  11   time of arrival  toa  /time of flight  tof   time of arrival  toa  systems are based on the accurate synchronization of the arrival time of a signal transmitted from a mobile device to several receiving beacons as shown in figure 5 in toa  the mobile device transmits a time stamped signal towards receiving beacons  when it is received  the distance between the mobile node and the receiving beacons is calculated from the transmission time delay and the corresponding speed of the signal  4 journal of computer networks and communications time = ? time = ? localization time = ? figure 6  time difference of arrival  source  31    figure 5  positioning based on toa/rtof measurements  toa method needs precise knowledge of the transmission start time  s   due to this  all receiving beacons along with mobile devices are accurately synchronized with a precise time source  toa is the most accurate technique used in indoor environment which can filter out multi-path effects  4   one of the disadvantages of toa approach is the requirement for precise time synchronization of all the devices  for time delay measurement  an additional server will be needed which will increase the cost of the system  along with this  increased delay can also be propagated by a denser environment  in terms of more people  time difference of arrival  tdoa   time difference of arrival  tdoa  techniques are measured between multiple pairs of reference points with known locations and use relative time measurements at each receiving node in place of absolute time measurements illustrated in figure 6 tdoa does not need the use of a synchronized time source of transmission in order to resolve timestamps and find the location  with tdoa  a transmission with an unknown starting time is received at various receiving nodes  with only the receivers requiring time synchronization  5   each difference of arrival time measurement produces a hyperbolic curve in the localization space on which the location of the mobile node lies  the intersection of multiple hyperbolic curves specifies the possible locations of the client  localization using tdoa is called multilateration  round trip time  rtt  /round-trip time of flight  rtof   it measures the time of flight of the signal pulse traveling from the transmitter to the measuring unit and back  3   in toa  calculating the delay is by using two local clocks in both nodes  while in rtt  it uses only one node to record the transmitting and arrival times  because of this advantage  this technology solves the problem of synchronization to some extent  one of the drawbacks of this method is range measurements to multiple devices that need to be carried out consecutively which may cause precarious latencies for applications where devices move quickly  3.2.3 signal property based method  the majority of wireless localization systems compute the distance to the positioning device using either timing information or angle based  in both scenarios  they are influenced by the multipath effect  due to this  the accuracy of estimated location can be decreased  the substitute method is to estimate the distance of unknown node to reference node from some sets of measuring units using the attenuation of emitted signal strength  3  12   this method can only be possible with radio signals  mostly wireless localization systems positioning device using properties of the received signal  with received signal strength indicator  rssi  being the most widely used signal-related feature  rssi measurement estimations depend heavily on the environmental interference  and they are also nonlinear  these methods work with the wifi technology  as this system needs a server for implementation  this technique can work using only access points which are cheaper than wi-fi routers  3.3 dead reckoning  dr   dead reckoning is the process of estimating known current position based on last determined position and incrementing that position based on known or estimated speeds over elapsed time  an inertial navigation system which provides very accurate directional information uses dead reckoning and is very widely applied  13   one of the disadvantages of dead reckoning is that the inaccuracy of the process is cumulative  so the deviation in the position fix grows with time  the reason is that new positions are calculated entirely from previous positions  research has been carried out  13  14  in indoor localization using dead reckoning  3.4 map matching  mm   this method is based on the theory of pattern recognition  15  which combines electronic map with locating information to obtain the real position of vehicles in a road network  the use of maps is an efficient alternative to the installation of additional hardware  mm techniques include topological analyses  pattern recognition  or advanced techniques such as hierarchical fuzzy inference algorithms  the authors of  16  17  present a recent research work on map matching algorithm based on indoor and lbs  respectively  journal of computer networks and communications 4 position systems this section presents a review of most prominent state-ofthe-art wireless positioning systems as shown in figure 7 our main focus is put on the radio based systems especially in wireless local area network  wlan  positioning  table 1   global positioning system  gps  is the most popular and worldwide radio navigation system to find the location and the position of the objects especially for outdoor environment  18   however  it does not work well in indoor setups because the presence of obstacles in the line of sight between the satellite and the receiver and electromagnetic waves is spread and attenuated by the buildings and outdoor obstacles  8   as people spend most of their time in a closed environment  indoors   gps is not well suited for indoor positioning tracking  table 3   infrared radiation  ir  positioning systems are one of the most common positioning systems that use wireless technology  the spectral region of infrared has been used in various ways for detection or tracking of objects or persons and available in various wired and wireless devices such as mobile phone  pdas  and tv  19   most ir based wireless devices uses line-of-sight  los  communication mode between transmitter and receiver without interference from strong light sources  20   the main advantage of using ir based system devices is being small  lightweight  and easy to carry out  the ir systems undertake an indoor positioning determination in a precise way  besides these  ir based indoor positioning systems have some disadvantages like security and privacy issues  ir signals have some limitations for location determination  like interference from fluorescent light and sunlight  4   beside this  the ir based indoor system has expensive system hardware and maintenance cost  radio frequency technologies  21  are commonly used in location position systems because of some advantages ; for example  radio waves can penetrate through obstacles like building walls and human bodies easily  due to this  the positioning system in rf based has a larger coverage area and needs less hardware comparing to other systems  in addition  rf based technologies are further divided into narrow band based technologies  rfid  bluetooth  wlan  and fm  and wide band based technologies  uwb   19   radar  22  by microsoft research was the first rf based technique for location determination and user tracking  radio frequency identification  rfid  has been recognized as the next promising technology in serving the positioning system for locating objects or people  rfid enables a one way wireless communication using a noncontact and advanced automatic identification technology that uses radio signals that put an rfid tag on people or objects  for the purpose of automatic identification  tracking  and management  tracking the movements of objects in rfid is done through a network of radio enabled scanning devices over a distance of several meters  rfid technology is used in a wide range of applications including people  automobile assembly industry  warehouse management  supply chain network  and assets without the need of line of sight contact  9   bluetooth is a wireless standard for wireless personal area networks  wpans   almost every wifi enabled mobile 5 device  such as mobile phone or computer  also has an embedded bluetooth module  bluetooth operates in the 2.4 ghz ism band  the benefit of using bluetooth for exchanging information between devices is that this technology is of high security  low cost  low power  and small size  each bluetooth tag has a unique id  which can be used for locating the bluetooth tag  there are several recent research works dedicated to bluetooth based localization systems  23  24   one of the drawbacks of using bluetooth technology in localization is that  in each location finding  it runs the device discovery procedure ; due to this  it significantly increases the localization latency  1030 s  and power consumption as well  that is why bluetooth device has a latency unsuitable for realtime positioning applications  ultrawideband  uwb  is a radio technology for shortrange  high-bandwidth communication holding the properties of strong multipath resistance  widespread use of uwb in a variety of localization applications requiring higher accuracy 2030 cm than achievable through conventional wireless technologies  e.g  radio frequency identification  rfid   wireless local area networks  wlan   etc    25   a typical uwb setup structures stimulus radio wave generator and receivers which capture the propagated and scattered wave  moreover  uwb hardware is expensive  making it costly for wide-scale use  the fm radio based system is popular through the ages  it is widely available across the globe especially in most households and in cars  fm radio uses the frequency-division multiple access  fdma  approach which splits the band into a number of separate frequency channels that are used by stations  fm band ranges and channel separation distances vary in different regions  there are only a few works dedicated to fm radio based positioning  recently  26  27  presented research that worked on indoor positioning using fm radio signals  the zigbee technology is an emerging wireless technology standard which provides solution for short and medium range communications due to its numerous benefits  28   it is mainly designed for applications which require low-power consumption but do not require large data throughput  the signal range coverage of a zigbee in indoor environments is typically 20 m to 30 m distance calculation between two zigbee nodes is usually carried out from rssi values  zigbee is open to interference from a wide range of signal types using the same frequency which can disrupt radio communication because it operates in the unlicensed ism bands  hu et al   7  deployed a zigbee based localization algorithm for indoor environments  beside this  fernandez et al   29  proposed a way to improve the position determination in an indoor location system  ils  based on the power levels  rssi  of an ad hoc zigbee network  hybrid positioning systems are defined as systems for determining the location of a mobile client combining several different positioning technologies  30   many location technologies are used to estimate the position of mobile client in a space or grid  based on some mathematical models  the local positioning systems fail to work outdoors  whereas the gps based positioning systems do not work inside buildings due to the absence of line of sight to the satellites  so  there 6 journal of computer networks and communications position system global position systems infrared based systems radio frequency based systems ultrasound based system wlan rfid bluetooth zigbee uwb fm hybrid figure 7  taxonomy of position systems  is a need for positioning systems that can work both indoors and outdoors  and hence  the concept of hybrid positioning systems is used  31   different hybrid positioning systems are currently being developed and used in services from combain mobile  navizon  xtify  placeengine  skyhook  devicescape  google maps for mobile  and sopenbmap for application in smartphones  ultrasound system is a technology based on the nature of bats and operates in the low frequency band compared to the other two signaling technologies  the ultrasound signals are used to estimate the position of the emitter tags from the receivers  ultrasound is unable to penetrate walls but reflects off most of the indoor obstructions  however  it has a lower level of accuracy  in centimeters  and suffers a lot of interference from reflected ultrasound signals propagated around by other sources such as the collision of metals  some recent research work  32  33  was carried out under ultrasound based indoor localization  4.1 wifi-based indoor localization  one of the advantages of using wifi positioning systems is to locate the position of almost every wifi compatible device without installing extra software or manipulating the hardware  beside this  in wlan  line of sight is not required  due to this advantage  wifi positioning systems have become the most widespread approach for indoor localization  11   most positioning systems based on wlan  wifi  are available as commercial products as prototypes based on measurements on the received signal strength  rss   wifi based positioning systems have several advantages  firstly in terms of cost effect  wlan infrastructures implementation of position algorithms does not need any additional hardware as network interface cards  nics  measure signal strength values from all wireless access points in range of the receiver  therefore  signals needed for positioning can be obtained directly from nics available on most handheld computing devices  due to the ubiquity of wlans  this mode of positioning provides a particularly cost-effective solution for offering lbs in commercial and residential indoor environments  34   secondly  wlan positioning systems offer scalability in two respects  first  no costly requirement of infrastructure and hardware and second the number of mobile devices subscribing to positioning services  beside this  there are also certain wlan limitations  signal attenuation of the static environment like wall  movement of furniture and doors  some of the wifi strengths  weaknesses  and opportunities are presented in table 2  4.2 fingerprinting based indoor localization  most indoor localization approaches adopted fingerprint matching as the basic scheme of location determination  the main theme is to collect features of the scene  fingerprint  from the surrounding signatures at every location in the areas of interest and then build a fingerprint database  the location of an object is then determined by matching online measurement with the closed location against the database  35   figure 8   this method does not require specialized hardware in either the mobile device or the receiving end nor is no time synchronization necessary between the stations  it may be implemented totally in software which can reduce complexity and cost significantly compared to angulation or purely timebased lateration systems  34   the location fingerprinting also called a fingerprinting method consists of two phases  5   phase 1 is the so-called calibration phase  offline phase  or training phase  and phase 2 is the localization phase or online phase  in the offline phase  maps for fingerprinting are set up either empirically in measurement operations or computed analytically  signal strength reference values  anchor point  can be computed using a signal propagation model   in the first phase  a creation of radio maps for site survey where the positioning is supposed to work must be recorded  basically  radio map is a database of spots at predefined points  coordinates  coupled with various radio signal characteristics  for example  rss  signal angles  or propagation time called signal fingerprints  step by step  for every fingerprint  there must journal of computer networks and communications 7

is operational  online phase  the mobile station measures signal properties at unknown spot  then  the current measured signal strength values are compared for the best agreement with a database  radio map   the major drawback of the fingerprinting approach is the laborious and cost notes  1  accuracy can be improved by using additional antenna  however  it will low increase the cost   2  accuracy is on the order of the size of the cells   1  accuracy depends on the antennas angular properties  high  2  location of antenna must be specified   1  time synchronization needs  high  2  location of antenna must be specified   1  need heavy calibration  medium  2  location of antenna is not necessary  inaccuracy of the process is low cumulative  so the deviation in the position fix grows with time   1  map matching purely focus on algorithms and not fully on position methods  coordinate transformation  medium and geocoding   2  using pattern recognition  high computing complex and poor real time issue occur  time-consuming calibration process  furthermore  adding signal stations would challenge the ease of setup in fingerprinting  beside this  the main challenge to the techniques based on location fingerprinting is sensitivity to environment changes such as object moving into the building  e.g  people  furniture   diffraction  and reflection  which result in changes in signal propagation  to maintain the positioning accuracy  the calibration process should be periodically repeated to a recalculation of the predefined signal strength map  fingerprinting-based positioning algorithms using pattern recognition techniques are deterministic and probabilistic  k-nearest-neighbor  knn   artificial neural networks  bayesian inference  support vector machine  svm   or their combinations  in this part of paper  we are presenting some recent research work done on wifi localization with a specific focus on fingerprinting-based localization technique  different approaches using wifi access points are studied from time to time  pereira et al   36  developed a functional application for a smartphone indoor/outdoor localization system publicly available for download with a name called locate me  it was developed for mobile devices running android os and takes advantage of the gps and wifi modules to acquire the location of a person  with this system  anybody can find their friends wherever they are  the application sends the current location of the device to the server where it is stored  from that moment on  8 journal of computer networks and

m  meters  all friends can access this position and see it on the map  google maps android api is used to represent the users location  and it has two views available  road view and satellite view  this location system is based on 4 different methods of localization  three for indoor environments and one for outdoors  the fingerprint localization method is used for indoor location  indoor localization using wifi based fingerprinting and trilateration techniques for lbs application is presented by s chan et al   37   the paper combined two different wifi approaches to locate a user in an indoor environment  the first method involves the use of fingerprint matching to compare signal strength data received from nearby access points  ap  by the user  to the reference data stored in the wifi signal strength database  the second approach uses distance-based trilateration approach using three known ap coordinates detected in the users device to derive the position  the combination of the two steps enhances the accuracy of the user position in an indoor environment allowing location based services  lbs  such as mobile augmented reality  mar  to be deployed more effectively in the indoor environment  an improvement is necessary for finding the correct match for the fingerprinting method with help of incorporating certain database correlation algorithms such as k-nearest-neighbor or probabilistic like a hidden markov model  in  38   the authors design a multifloor indoor positioning system based on bayesian graphical models  bgm   in this paper  the author first studied the rss properties that will affect the overall accuracy of our model like a journal of computer networks and communications 9 indoor environment office getting rssi fingerprint offline

figure 8  fingerprinting based positioning  normal distribution of rss  using rss in infer location  and multifloor effect  markov chain monte carlo  mcmc  sampling techniques are used  at the last stage  the author tested their model with four sets of mcmc sampling techniques and compared their results with two well-known location determination systems  radar and the horus   the achieved accuracy is 2  3 m in a multi-floor environment with a small amount of training points  by using wi-fi  it is possible to define the position of people or assets with good accuracy  in  39   the authors proposed a novel positioning algorithm named predicted k-nearest-neighbor  pknn  which estimates the current position of a mobile user not only by using k found neighbors but also by utilizing its previous positions and speed  in the first stage of the experiment  weighted k-nearest neighbors  wknn  are used for the position of the tag which is to be estimated  in the second stage  prediction is done for the next probable displacement  based on previous user positions and speeds of wi-fi tags  the performance of pknn for indoor positioning has been evaluated by the experimental test bed  by comparison with knn  pknn performs well by 33 % or at mean 1.3 meter improvement in error  a novel  information-theoretic approach is presented by fang and lin  40  for building a wlan-based indoor positioning system based on the location fingerprinting system  the proposed technique is based on principal component analysis  pca  which transforms received signal strength  rss  into principal components  pcs  such that the information of all access points  aps  is more efficiently utilized  instead of selecting aps for the positioning which was done by previous researchers  the proposed technique changes the elements with a subset of pcs improvement of accuracy and reduces the online computation  the comparison has been done with ap selection and the horus system  the proposed approach delivers a significantly improved accuracy  the results show that the mean error is reduced by 33.75 percent and the complexity is decreased by 40 percent  received signal strength indication  rssi  is defined by the ieee 802.11 standard  it is a measurement of the rf energy  and the unit is dbm  mobile client  mc  can get the rssi from access point  ap  on the wlan  the rssi is decreased exponentially as the distance from ap increased  and this can be expressed by log path loss model  reference  41  has been presented  using dominant aps rssi localization  darl  algorithms  using dual log model because of attenuation factor  the parameters are classified into two parts  firstly  darl algorithm uses the strongest rssi from an ap  secondly  ap trace-back algorithm was suggested as the method for updating the information of unknown ap on the radio map  optimal filtering system to the proposed algorithm is needed for getting more increased accuracy  fingerprinting accuracy performance depends on the number of base stations and the density of calibration points where the fingerprints are taken  recorded rssi varies in time  even if there are no changes to the environment  in order to eliminate the deviation of attenuation in the signal  the rss values are to be averaged over a certain time interval up to several minutes at each fingerprint location  hansen et al   42  draw on active user participation relying on the contribution of end users by marking their location on a floor plan while recording the fingerprints  the author concludes from long-term measurements over a period of two months that static radio maps can not be used for room identification even in modest dynamic environments and therefore recommends dynamically adapting algorithms  in  43   the author presents the design  implementation  and evaluation of a fine-grained indoor fingerprinting system  fifs  as shown in figure 5 data are modulated on multiple subcarriers at different frequencies and transmitted simultaneously in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  ofdm   the author takes the value that estimates the channel in each subcarrier called channel state information  csi   different from rssi  csi is a fine-grained value from 10 the phy layer which describes the amplitude and phase on each subcarrier in the frequency domain  to obtain high accuracy and low complexity of indoor localization  the fifs was comprised of two parts  first  the process of raw csi values of measurement by integrating frequency diversity  amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths  and spatial diversity of location using multiple antennas  and then it builds up a radio map ; second  determining the position of objects by correlation calculation augmented with a probability algorithm  an experiment is done in two typical indoor scenarios with commercial ieee 802.11 nics  the median accuracy of 0  65 m is improved compared with the rss-based horus system 0.2 with gain of about 24 %  aboodi and tat-chee  44  proposed an indoor positioning algorithm called wifi-based indoor  wbi  positioning algorithm  wbi-based on wifi received signal strength  rss  technology in conjunction with trilateration techniques  the wbi algorithm estimates the location using rss values previously collected from within the area of interest using lse algorithm  determines whether it falls within the minmax bounding box  corrects for nonline-of-sight propagation effects on positioning errors using kalman filtering  and finally updates the location estimation using least square estimation  lse   the paper analyzed the complexity of the proposed algorithm and compares its performance against existing algorithms  furthermore  the proposed wbi algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 2.6 m the authors of  45  proposed a gps-like zeroconfiguration indoor positioning system based on received signal strength  rss  of the popular wifi network as shown in figure 9 the proposed system does not require a time-consuming offline radio survey prior knowledge about the area or new hardware unlike current rss-based indoor systems  similar to gps  the proposed system consists of three sections as shown in figure 9  network segment  wifi   control segment  and user segment  between network segment and control segment  rss observations are exchanged periodically  the control segment uses a novel hybrid propagation modeling  pm  technique using logarithmic decay model augmented by a nonlinear gaussian process regression  gpr  that models rss residuals that can not be modeled by the traditional logarithmic decay models indoors  the proposed system provides 2-3 m accuracy in indoor environments  yang et al   46  proposed a wireless indoor localization approach called locating in fingerprint space  lifs   in fingerprinting method  radio base requires a process of site survey  in which radio signatures of an interested area are marked with their real recorded locations  site survey involves intensive costs on manpower and time and is vulnerable to environmental dynamics  the author investigates the sensors integrated in modern mobile phones and user motions to construct the radio map of a floor plan  which is previously obtained only by site survey  on this basis  they design lifs  an indoor localization system based on off-theshelf wifi infrastructure and mobile phones  an experiment was performed in an office building covering over 1600 m2  and the results show that lifs achieves low human cost  rapid system

increase in the maximum net data rate from 54 mbit/s to 600 mbit/s  it also improves wlan standard in terms of network throughput by adding a technology which supports multiple antenna configurations  known as multiple-input multiple-output  mimo   xiong and jamieson  47  presented arraytrack  an indoor location system that uses angle-of-arrival techniques to locate wireless clients indoors in a wireless local area network  arraytrack combines best of breed algorithms for aoa based direction estimation and spatial smoothing with novel algorithms for suppressing non-line-of-sight reactions that occur frequently indoors  based on simulation  arraytrack achieved median 25 cm location accuracy when clients are stationary indoors  5 conclusion and future trends this paper surveys the recent advances in wireless indoor localization techniques and system  different technological solutions for wireless indoor positioning and navigation are discussed  and several tradeoffs among them are observed  regardless of the plenty of approaches which exist to handle the indoor positioning problem  current solutions can not cope with the performance level that significant applications required  in short  requirements for different application environments are accuracy/precision  coverage  availability  and minimal costs for local installations  to achieve this shortcoming  a good portion of research approaches is required to handle these challenges  some of the future trends of wireless indoor positioning systems are as follows   1  new hybrid solution for positioning and tracking estimation in 4g with the currently available position system   2  need of cooperative mobile localization which will help mobile nodes among each other to determine their locations  journal of computer networks and communications  3  new innovative applications for mobile in which location information can be used to improve the quality of users experience and to add value to existing
