state university  east lansing  mi 48824  usa abstract  growing convergence among mobile computing devices and embedded technology sparks the development and deployment of context-aware applications  where location is the most essential context  in this paper we present landmarc  a location sensing prototype system that uses radio frequency identification  rfid  technology for locating objects inside buildings  the major advantage of landmarc is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags  based on experimental analysis  we demonstrate that active rfid is a viable and cost-effective candidate for indoor location sensing  although rfid is not designed for indoor location sensing  we point out three major features that should be added to make rfid technologies competitive in this new and growing market  keywords  location-aware computing  sensing network  rfid  signal strength  wireless communication 1 introduction the proliferation of wireless technologies  mobile computing devices  and the internet has fostered a growing interest in location-aware systems and services  many applications need to know the physical location of objects  over the years  many systems have addressed the problem of automatic locationsensing  triangulation  scene analysis  and proximity are the three principal techniques for automatic location-sensing  8   one of the most well known location-based systems is the global positioning system  gps   a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit  6   gps is widely used to track moving objects located outdoors  however  gps  as it is satellite dependent  has an inherent problem of accurately determining the location of objects located inside buildings  different approaches have been proposed and tested for their effectiveness and utilities in order to achieve the ability to locate objects within buildings  the objective of our research is to develop an indoor location-sensing system for various mobile commerce applications  our goal is to implement a prototype indoor location-sensing system using easily accessible wireless devices so that we can make use of existing infrastructures  at present  there are several types of location-sensing systems  each having their own strengths as well as limitations  infrared  802.11  ultrasonic  and rfid are some examples of these systems  section 2 will give a comparative overview of these technologies and some related work  we are interested in using commodity off-the-shelf products  the results of our comparative studies reveal that there are several advantages of the rfid technology  the no contact and non-line corresponding author  e-mail  ni @ cs.ust.hk of-sight nature of this technology are significant advantages common among all types of rfid systems  all rf tags can be read despite extreme environmental factors  such as snow  fog  ice  paint  and other visually and environmentally challenging conditions  they can also work at remarkable speeds  in some cases  tags can be read in less than a 100 milliseconds  the other advantages are their promising transmission range and cost-effectiveness  section 3 will give an overview of the rfid technology  section 4 introduces landmarc  a location-sensing prototype system based on rfid technologies  since rfid is not designed for location sensing  the purpose of our prototype indoor location-sensing system is to investigate whether the rfid technology is suitable for locating objects with accuracy and cost-effectiveness  in section 5  we present the experimental results of the landmarc system  based on the analysis of this study  suggestions are given for manufacturers of rfid products to use these products in alternative and viable ways  section 6 concludes the paper and describes future research  2 related work a number of wireless technologies have been used for indoor location sensing  infrared  active badge  developed at olivetti research laboratory  now at & t cambridge   used diffuse infrared technology  15  to realize indoor location positioning  the line-of-sight requirement and short-range signal transmission are two major limitations that suggest it to be less than effective in practice for indoor location sensing  ieee 802.11 radar is an rf based system for locating and tracking users inside buildings  3   using a standard 702 ni et al  802.11 network adapter to measure signal strengths at multiple base stations positioned to provide overlapping coverage in a given area  this system combines empirical measurements and signal propagation modeling in order to determine user location thereby enabling location-aware services and applications  the major strengths of this system are that it is easy to set up  requires few base stations  and uses the same infrastructure that provides general wireless networking in the building  the difficulty is that the object being tracked must be supported by a wave lan nic  which may be impractical on small or power constrained devices  in most cases to date  the overall accuracy of the systems  using 802.11 technologies  is not as optimal as desired  for example  radars implementation can place objects to within about 3 meters of their actual position with 50 percent probability  while the signal strength lateration implementation has 4.3-meter accuracy at the same probability level  8   figure 1 rfid system components  ultrasonic  the cricket location support system  11  and active bat location system  7  are two primary examples that uses the ultrasonic technology  normally  these systems use an ultrasound time-of-flight measurement technique to provide location information  most of them share a significant advantage  which is the overall accuracy  cricket  for example  can accurately delineate 4 4 square-feet regions within a room while active bat can locate bats to within 9 cm of their true position for 95 percent of the measurements  however  the use of ultrasonic this way requires a great deal of infrastructure in order to be highly effective and accurate  yet the cost is so exorbitant that it is inaccessible to most users  rfid  one well-known location sensing systems using the rfid technology is spoton  10   spoton uses an aggregation algorithm for three dimensional location sensing based on radio signal strength analysis  spoton researchers have designed and built hardware that will serve as object location tags  in the spoton approach  objects are located by homogenous sensor nodes without central control  spoton tags use received radio signal strength information as a sensor measurement for estimating inter-tag distance  however  a complete system has not been made available as of yet  the above are popular technologies for indoor location sensing  some other technologies  such as ultra-wideband  1   are also being investigated  the choice of technique and technology significantly affects the granularity and accuracy of the location information  there are some other projects using the above technologies  due to the lack of availability of cost-effective indoor location sensing products  we have tried both infrared and 802.11b products  neither was satisfactory for the above reasons  we do not intend to build our own devices due to cost constraint  we selected commercially available rfid devices as our prototyping technology  which is described below  3 rfid technology and our first attempt rfid  rf identification  is a means of storing and retrieving data through electromagnetic transmission to an rf compatible integrated circuit and is now being seen as a radical means of enhancing data handling processes  5   an rfid system has several basic components including a number of rfid readers  rfid tags  and the communication between them  figure 1   the rfid reader can read data emitted from rfid tags  rfid readers and tags use a defined radio frequency and protocol to transmit and receive data  rfid tags are categorized as either passive or active  passive rfid tags operate without a battery  they reflect the rf signal transmitted to them from a reader and add information by modulating the reflected signal  passive tags are mainly used to replace the traditional barcode technology and are much lighter and less expensive than active tags  offering a virtually unlimited operational lifetime  however  their read ranges are very limited  active tags contain both a radio transceiver and a buttoncell battery to power the transceiver  since there is an onboard radio on the tag  active tags have more range than passive tags  active tags are ideally suited for the identification of high-unit-value products moving through a tough assembly process  they also offer the durability essential for permanent identification of captive product carriers  after looking into the specifications of different available systems  we have chosen the spider system manufactured by rf code  13  to implement the prototype framework  their active tags have a read range of 150 feet  if necessary  this range can be increased to 1000 feet with the addition of a special antenna  figure 2 shows the rfid readers and tags used in our system and their relative size compared with a us quarter  the range that can be achieved in an rfid system is essentially determined by  2   landmarc  indoor location sensing using active rfid 703 figure 2 the rfid reader and tag used in our prototype system  the power available at the reader/interrogator to communicate with the tag  s   the power available within the tag to respond  the environmental conditions and structures  the former being more significant at higher frequencies including signal to noise ratio   the field or wave delivered from an antenna extends into the space surrounding it and its strength diminishes with respect to distance  the antenna design will determine the shape of the field or propagation wave delivered  so that range will also be influenced by the angle subtended between the tag and antenna  in space free of any obstructions or absorption mechanisms  the strength of the field reduces in inverse proportion to the square of the distance  in our system  the rfid readers operating frequency is 308 mhz  it also has an 802.11b interface to communicate with other machines  the detection range is 150 feet  the reader provides digital control of read range via providing configuration software and api with 8 incremental read ranges  each reader can detect up to 500 tags in 7.5 seconds  each rfid tag is pre-programmed with a unique 7-character id for identification by readers  its battery life is 35 years  tags send their unique id signal in random with an average of 7.5 seconds  note that the rfid reader has 8 different power levels  based on the signal strength received by the rfid reader  the reader will report or ignore the received id  where power level 1 has the shortest range and level 8 has the longest range  our first attempt is to install a number of readers as shown in figure 3 each reader has a pre-determined power level  thus defining a certain range in which it can detect rfid tags  by properly placing the readers in known locations  the whole region can be divided into a number of sub-regions  where each sub-region can be uniquely identified by the subset of readers that cover that sub-region  given an rfid tag  based on the subset of readers that can detect it  we should be able to associate that tag with a known sub-region  the accuracy of this approach is then determined by the number of readers required  the placement of these readers  and the power level of each reader  such a nicely formulated optimization problem turns out to be useless because the range in which a reader can detect a tagged object is not just due to the power level  similar to signal strength   there are many factors that will affect the range including both static obstructions and dynamic human movement  due to these dynamic interferences  even a static object could be reported in different sub-regions from figure 3 placement of 9 readers with two different ranges and the subregions  time to time  this is the same reason why approaches based on the signal strength of 802.11b are not very useful  4 landmarc approach in order to increase accuracy without placing more readers  the landarc  location identification based on dynamic active rfid calibration  system employs the idea of having extra fixed location reference tags to help location calibration  these reference tags serve as reference points in the system  like landmarks in our daily life   the proposed approach has three major advantages  first  there is no need for a large number of expensive rfid readers  instead we use extra  cheaper rfid tags  second  the environmental dynamics can easily be accommodated  our approach helps offset many environmental factors that contribute to the variations in detected range because the reference tags are subject to the same effect in the environment as the tags to be located  thus  we can dynamically update the reference information for lookup based on the detected range from the reference tags in real-time  third  the location information is more accurate and reliable  the landmarc approach is more flexible and dynamic and can achieve much more accurate and close to real-time location sensing  obviously  the placement of readers and reference tags is very important to the overall accuracy of the system  the landmarc approach does require signal strength information from each tag to readers  if it is within the detectable range  however  the current rfid system does not provide the signal strength of tags directly to readers  readers only report the power level  18 in our system  of the tag detected  we might do a preliminary measurement to know 704 which power level corresponds to what distance  however  this may work only in free space  as indicated earlier  the power level distribution is dynamic in a complicated indoor environment  thus  the physical distance can not be computed accurately by using power levels directly  we have to develop an algorithm to reflect the relations of signal strengths by power levels  4.1 system setup the prototype environment consists of a sensing network that helps the location tracking of mobile users/objects within certain granularity and accuracy  and a wireless network that enables the communication between mobile devices and the internet  the sensing network primarily includes the rf readers and rf tags as mentioned earlier  the other major part of the infrastructure is the wireless network that allows wireless communication between mobile devices like pdas and the internet  in addition  it also acts as a bridge between the sensing network and the other part of the system  as the reader is equipped with the capability of communicating wirelessly using ieee 802.11b wireless network  all the tag information gathered from readers is sent over to the supplied api sitting on a specific server  the location server   this feature does not have the problem of having a wire-connection to the readers  thus reducing the possible restrictions of where the readers could be placed  in addition  the wireless network will serve as the fundamental framework of all the communications in the infrastructure  to be able to track an objects location  the location information received from the rf readers has to be processed before being useful  the following is a brief explanation of some of the major configuration values in the api software  device  rf readers  setup  used for configuring the ip addresses of the rf readers  range  used for specifying what range for tags is to be scanned  mode  exception versus continuous    1  exception mode  the reader will report the tag when it is inside the detected range while it will not report again until the reader realizes the tag has gone out of range   2  continuous mode  the reader will continuously report the tag id as long as it was in the configured range  time/tag limit per log file  used to configure how long and how much tag events recorded before the api will start a new log file  this is  in fact  somewhat critical to the configuration in the sense of its effect on efficiency  after the signal is received by the rf readers  the readers then report the information to tagtracker concentrator li  a software program/api provided by rf code  inc  via a wired or wireless network  moreover  the software also acts as a central configuration interface for the rf readers  for example  it can be used to adjust the detection range and rate of the readers  after the information from the readers is processed by the tagtracker concentrator li  the processed ni et al  location information can be buffered locally as a file on the same machine or transmitted via a network socket  configurable in the api   4.2 methodology suppose we have n rf readers along with m tags as reference tags and u tracking tags as objects being tracked  the readers are all configured with continuous mode  continuously reporting the tags that are within the specified range  and a detection-rang of 18  meaning the reader will scan from range 18 and keep repeating the cycle with a rate of 30 seconds per range   we define the signal strength vector of a tracking/moving tag as s =  s1  s2      sn  where si denotes the signal strength of the tracking tag perceived on reader i  where i  1  n   for the reference tags  we denote the corresponding signal strength vector as =  1  2      n  where i denotes the signal strength  we introduce the euclidean distance in signal strengths  for each individual tracking tag p  where p  1  u   we define   n 2 ej = i=1  i si  where j  1  m   as the euclidean distance in signal strength between a tracking tag and a reference tag rj  let e denotes the location relationship between the reference tags and the tracking tag  i.e  the nearer reference tag to the tracking tag is supposed to have a smaller e value  when there are m reference tags  a tracking tag has its e vector as e =  e1  e2      em   this algorithm is to find the unknown tracking tags nearest neighbors by comparing different e values  since these e values are only used to reflect the relations of the tags  we use the reported value of the power level to take the place of the value of signal strength in the equation  there are three key issues we examine through the process of locating the unknown tracking tags  the first issue is the placement of the reference tags  since the unknown tag is ultimately located in a cell surrounded by some reference tags  the layout of reference tags may significantly affect the location accuracy of an algorithm  the second issue is to determine the number of reference tags in a reference cell that are used in obtaining the most accurate approximate coordinate for each unknown tracking tag  for example  the simplest way to find the nearest reference tag to the tracking tag is to use the coordinate of the reference tag with the smallest e value as the unknown tags coordinate  we call this as 1-nearest neighbor algorithm  or  we can choose a tracking tags two nearest neighbors and call it 2-nearest neighbor algorithm  when we use k nearest reference tags coordinates to locate one unknown tag  we call it k-nearest neighbor algorithm  the unknown tracking tag coordinate  x  y  is obtained by   x  y  = k  wi  xi  yi   i=1 where wi is the weighting factor to the ith neighboring reference tag  the choice of these weighting factors is another design parameter  giving all k nearest neighbors with the same landmarc  indoor location sensing using active rfid  a  705  b  figure 4   a  placement of rf readers and tags  standard placement    b  placement of rf readers and tags  placement configuration 2   weight  i.e  wi = 1/k  would make a lot of errors  thus  the third issue is to determine the weights assigned to different neighbors  intuitively  wi should depend on the e value of each reference tag in the cell  i.e  wi is a function of the e values of k-nearest neighbors  we have tried different ways to define weight  empirically  in landmarc  weight is given by  1/ei2  wj = k 2 i=1 1/ei this approach provides the least error in most of the experiments  which means the reference tag with the smallest e value has the largest weight  this may be explained by the fact that the signal strength is inverse proportional to the square of the distance  note that our approach can be easily extended to a 3-dimensional coordinate  5 experimental results and performance evaluation we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate performance of the positioning of the landmarc system  in the standard setup  we place 4 rf readers  n = 4  in our lab and 16 tags  m = 16  as reference tags while the other 8 tags  u = 8  as objects being tracked  as illustrated in figure 4  a   with the setup  the data are collected via the socket from the tagtracker concentrator li in groups of a one-hour pe riod and the system will compute the coordinates of the tracking tags based on each group of data  to quantify how well the landmarc system performs  the error distance is used as the basis for the accuracy of the system  we define the location estimation error  e  to be the linear distance between the tracking tags real coordinates  x0  y0  and the computed coordinates  x  y   given by  e =  x x0  2 +  y y0  2  with the placement of the reference tags and the tracking tags shown in figure 4 for over 48 hours  we keep collecting data of the power levels from 4 rf readers continuously  thus we obtain 48 groups of one-hour data  for each of 8 tracking tags per hour  the system computes the coordinates of this tag by using the algorithm discussed in section 4 we then compute the location error e for each tracking tag  thus  we have 48 groups of 8e values  we may examine the location accuracy by analyzing the distribution of these e values under different conditions  note that we have repeated the experiments many times to avoid statistical errors  5.1 effect of the number of nearest neighbors one of the key issues is to find a best k value in the algorithm  we choose different k values as k = 1  2  3  4  and 5 and compute the coordinates of the tracking tags  respec 706 figure 5 cumulative percentile of error distance for k from 2 to 5 ni et al  figure 7 cumulative percentile of error distance between two tracking tag placement configurations in figure 4 figure 8 cumulative percentile of error distance for 3 and 4 rf readers  figure 6 cumulative percentile of error distance in the daytime and at night  tively  figure 5 shows the results of using different k values in the formula  as shown in figure 5  k = 4 works the best and the positioning accuracy does not improve as the k value further increases  keeping the same placement  we repeat the process for another 48 hours  though the positioning error distribution changes  k = 4 still gives the best location information  in fact  in all the later experiments except on a few occasions that k = 3 and k = 5 worked better  in most cases k = 4 is the best choice  hence  we set 4 as the value of k in our formula in the following experiments  based on the statistics  it can be seen that the 50 percentile has an error distance of around 1 meter while the maximum error distances are less than 2 meters  this is very promising because the 50 percentile of the radar project is around 2.372.65 m and its 90 percentile is around 5.935.97 m  4   5.2 influence of the environmental factors in order to see how well the landmarc approach works in different environments  we collect 10 groups of data from midnight to early morning  during which time there is little movement  and another 10 groups of data from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm  at which time varying level of activities that would result in variations in transmission of the tags   figure 6 shows the comparison  we know that during the daytime  the lab is very busy with many people so there is more interference than at night  from the results  we do not see much difference in the overall accuracy  this shows that our reference tag approach can successfully offset the dynamics of interference  as the positions of tracking tags in the real world would be unpredictable  we change the placements of tracking tags randomly and expect the distribution of e could be changed but the accuracy of the system should be at the same level  we change the placement of the tracking tags as shown in figure 4  b  with the reference tags placement unchanged and repeat the process  figure 7 is the comparison of the results between the two tracking tag placements shown in figure 4 as we expected  the distribution is changed but the overall accuracy is at the same level  figures 6 and 7 show that the approach of using reference tags effectively helps offset some of the environmental factors that contribute to the variations in a detected range  since the reference tags are subject to the same effect in the environment as the tags to be located  we can dynamically update the reference information for lookup  based on the detected range from the reference tags in real-time  5.3 effect of the number of readers one of the problems of using rf to locate objects is the inconsistency of the signal strength reception  this can primarily be due to the environment and the device itself  in most cases  the environmental factors always have the most impact on the accuracy and maximum detectable range  these include issues like furniture placement  peoples movement  and so on  besides  non-line of sight  nlos  is another source of reducing the location sensing accuracy  even nlos does not prohibit rf transmission as that of infrared  it does create the multi-path problem  meaning the signal can possibly take different paths to reach the receiver and result in interference among the received signals  to better deal with the problem  we can use more rf readers to improve the accuracy  with more rf readers  a better decision can be made for location sensing because more data can be gathered by having extra readers to do the sensing as shown in figure 8 however  the rf readers are usually quite expensive so placing more readers means extra costs for the landmarc  indoor location sensing using active rfid 707 figure 9 a physical partition to separate reference tags c and f from others  whole system  due to budget constraints  we have only four rf readers  adding more readers may not necessary significantly increase the accuracy  it does increase the processing overhead  5.4 effect of placement of reference tags intuitively  placement of reference tags should have an effect on the measurement accuracy  consider the two configurations shown in figure 9 in the case of figure 9  a   where there is not any obstacle  it is probable that the system can easily find the tracking tags four nearest neighbors which are tags e  f  h  i by comparing the reported signal strengths and ef could be the smallest in this tracking tags e vector  thus  the tracking tag could be located among the four reference tags  however  sometimes the environment could be more complicated  suppose there is a partition  or sometimes even a person standing like the partition  as shown in figure 9  b   under these circumstances  it is possible that the reception of the signal strength from the reference tag f is influenced by the partition  or the unexpected people   consequently  the readers will report a weaker signal strength from tag f so that tag f could fail to be included in the four neighbors of the tracking tag  instead  tag k may become one of the four reported nearest neighbors to the tracking tag as shown in figure 9  b   using e  h  i  k as the four reported neighbors  the position of the tracking tag is likely to be computed as indicated in figure 9  b   thus  more error occurs  things will change if we place more reference tags as illustrated in figure 10 around the tracking tag  now we have figure 10 more reference tags are used   a  without a physical partition   b  with a physical partition  placed more reference tags  the green ones in the figure   together with the tag i  tags m  n  o could be included in the four reported nearest neighbors of the tracking tag  thus  better location information will be provided  708 ni et al   a   a   b   b  figure 11 two higher density  comparing with those in figure 4  placements of reference tags  figure 13 two lower density  comparing with those in figure 4  placements of reference tags  figure 12 cumulative percentile of error distance with a higher reference tag density  figure 14 cumulative percentile of error distance with a lower reference tag density  landmarc  indoor location sensing using active rfid in our next experiment  we place all of the reference tags with a higher density as shown in figure 11 in the first 48 hours we keep the original positions of all the tracking tags unchanged  case near 1 in figure 11   in the next 48 hours we move the positions of the tracking tags as indicated in the case of near 2 in figure 11 it can be seen in figure 12 that the accuracy of the landmarc system is improved with a higher reference tag density  as we have discussed  however  the improvement is not as great as we expected  we will discuss this point later  figure 13 shows two configurations of a lower reference tag density  the corresponding distribution of error distance is shown in figure 14 as expected  the accuracy has dropped quite significantly  it is obvious that the accuracy of the landmarc approach decreases greatly with a lower density of reference tags  thus  there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and the number of reference tags  conceivably  we can improve the accuracy of the landmarc system by placing as many reference tags as we can  for example  even in every cubic square centimeter of the space where we want to locate objects  this does not make much sense due to the increased complexity  overheads  inherent device error  and measurement error  the experimental results have indicated that the landmarc approach works well  using 4 rf readers in our lab  we roughly need one reference tag per square meter to accurately locate the objects within the error distance such that the worst error is 2 meters and the average is about 1 meter  we believe that the accuracy can be greatly improved if rfid vendors can make some design changes to be discussed in the next section  6 conclusions and future research this paper has presented a prototype indoor location sensing system using active rfid  active rfid is not designed for accurate indoor location sensing  a detection range of 150 feet does not provide needed accuracy for many practical applications  the proposed landmarc approach does show that active rfid is a viable cost-effective candidate for accurate indoor location sensing  however  there are three problems that rfid vendors have to overcome in order to compete in a new and growing market  the first problem is that none of the currently available rfid products provides the signal strength of tags directly  instead  the reader reports detectable or not detectable in a given range  this forces landmarc to spend approximately one minute each time to scan the 8 discrete power levels and to estimate the signal strength of tags  by sending the signal strength information directly from readers  it will not only eliminate unnecessary processing time  but also reduce errors  this feature can easily be added as readers do have the signal strength information from tags  the second problem is the long latency between a tracking tag being physically placed to its location being computed by the location server  there are two factors contributing to this 709 long latency  one is the scanning time of different power levels as indicated above  this factor can be eliminated by sending the signal strength directly  the second factor is the time interval of emitting two consecutive ids from an active tag  our product has an average interval of 7.5 seconds in order to avoid signal collision for handling up to 500 tags  depending on the total number of tags expected in a detectable area  this time interval can be further reduced  rfid vendors should provide a mechanism to allow users to reconfigure the time interval  the third problem is the variation of the behavior of tags  when employing the landmarc approach  the basic assumption is that all tags have roughly the same signal strength in emitting the rf signal  in our experiments we found that the power level detected by the same reader from two tags in an identical location may be different  a possible explanation for the difference may be due to the variation of the chips and circuits  as well as batteries  in fact  before our experiments  we had conducted a series of pre-tests to classify tags based on their signal strength  repeated experiments are needed to classify these tags due to the potential signal collision causing a detectable tag not detectable  this is another factor decreasing the accuracy of the system  if all the above problems can be overcome  the accuracy and latency will be greatly improved  however  the error due to the dynamics of the environment can hardly be alleviated  a major advantage of landmarc is to help offset some of the environmental factors that contribute to the variation of accuracy of locating objects  however  the dynamic environment is still one of the main reasons for increasing measurement errors  as we can never guarantee all the nearest neighbors and the tracking tag itself are always influenced equally  sometimes a person standing in front of a tracking tag may greatly increase the error distance of locating this tag and such an error is often unpredictable  in our experiments all reference tags are organized in a grid array  this may explain the reason of using 4 nearest neighbors  the influence of having other shapes of reference tags to the selection of the number of nearest neighbors will be investigated  in the practical application of landmarc  the placement of reference tags may be dependent on the configuration and layout of the environment  our methodology can easily be applied to 3d coordinates  in this case  the number of nearest neighbors to be considered is likely to be increased from 4 to 8 the accuracy of the 3d case will also be studied  we are also investigating the use of bluetooth for location sensing based on the same methodology  each bluetooth device emits a 48-bit unique id  but with a shorter range of up to 10 meters  as bluetooth  like rfid  is not designed for location sensing  it also has some inherent problems  the implementation of a location-sensing system based on bluetooth is currently taking place in our lab  acknowledgements this research was supported in part by the nsf grant eia9911074  michigan state university irgp grant
