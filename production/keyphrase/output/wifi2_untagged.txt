service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012 1 current approches of wifi positioning robin henniges  tu-berlin  2012 abstractwifi positioning plays an increasingly important role in improving performance because good positioning can improve performance in indoor environments without additional devices  it will make use of existing wifi infrastructure  although this was never designed to do so  methods that were used for other positioning technologies can be adopted for wifi  whether or not these other methods work with wifi will be explained and examined  this paper also discusses the accuracy of the methods and the optimal area of application  index termswifi  wlan  positioning  location  position determination  localization  fingerprinting i i i ntroduction n 1978 the first gps satellite was launched14 and in 1995 gps worked with its full capability for the first time.1 unfortunately  the satellite signals were not strong enough to work indoors  in 1997 ieee standard 802.11 was set and the first version of wireless lan was born  nowadays wireless local area network technology can be found in almost every building  this widespread infrastructure offers the possibility to locate mobile devices in an economical way  position determination using wifi technology has the advantage that it can perform indoors and outdoors  in a different way to gps  and  although wifi was never made for positioning  it is more accurate than a gsm indoor positioning20 and  in some cases  it is also more accurate in regards to outdoors  by using wifi positioning systems it is possible to locate the position of almost every wifi compatible device without installing extra software or manipulating the hardware  in the course of time many methods that were initially used with other positioning technologies were applied to wifi positioning  wifi positioning also allows the use of location-based services  lbs  indoors  which is interesting for the industry  useful applications of this technology are  for example  for indoor navigation at shopping malls or for finding a lost child in an indoor area  lost devices or items can also be found with this technology  additionally  this technology is especially interesting for hospitals because sometimes when staff move certain pieces of equipment it can be hard to find them again straight away  big corporate companies like google have already seen the potential of this system called wifi positioning  as we all know  google captures photos  gps positions and wifi measurements  while collecting data for the google street view project4 .5 this data was the basis for the hybrid outdoors positioning system that they use today  if a smartphone user turns on wifi and google maps  he also collects new wifi positioning data for google  the device scans for stations  in this case access points  and  at the same time  it determines the position with gps  gsm or known wifi stations  in november 2011  google published google indoors which enables navigation in buildings  it is fig  1 illustration of indoorpositioning use cases  source  http  //www.gpsworld.com/wireless/indoor-positioning/  also based on wifi technology.16 even in large train stations or airports  a wifi positioning system could help people to find out when their next train or plane leaves  the programming of autonomous robots often has the problem that the robot does not always know where they are  wifi positioning could support the mechanisms that are already in place  the second chapter is about the basic theory of wifi technology  802.11 is introduced and physical problems are discussed  the third chapter is about the positioning theory  the three topologies are explained and the different environment of indoors and outdoors are discussed in terms of positioning  the fourth chapter deals with the methods that are available for positioning  each method is examined to find out whether it advertises itself to the topologies and whether it is suitable for indoor wifi positioning systems  this paper is about the methods that can be used to build a wifi positioning system  ii  w ifi t echnology a wlan  wi-fi and ieee 802.11 wlan  wifi and ieee 802.11 all mean the same  they determine the industrial standard for wireless data transmission  the latter is the most used expression  wifi uses electromagnetic waves to transmit data over the airwaves  in figure 2  p 2  the whole frequency spectrum is shown  starting with radio signals and ending with gammarays  looking at the illustration one can see that it operates in broadband  on about 2,4 ghz and 5 ghz.10 other longer distance technologies also use frequencies in between these figures  the frequency is the number of wave occurrences per unit of time  in the best case  the radio waves spread out evenly and lose more and more of their signal strength with increasing radius  service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012 2 a wifi connection gives us information about signal strength and interference  for example  signal strength  -52 dbm  0,00001 mw  interference  -90 dbm because of the path loss  the signal becomes weaker and weaker the farther it is away from its origin  barriers may attenuate the signal  more about that later   the property to the path loss can be used to determine the distance  b problems and disruptive factors fig  2 frequency overview  a wifi wave matches into a baseball  this loss of signal strength is due to the energy transformation because  in physics  energy is never lost  but instead converted  consequently the amplitude of the signal becomes smaller and smaller  in an outdoor station the radius ratio of distance to signal strength is inversely proportional  because the decrease of the signal is log-normal.12 in conclusion  if the distance to the station is increased in any direction  the signal strength will decrease steadily  however  indoors we encounter a different problem  because the waves bump into walls  windows  doors and so on  if a wave bumps into a different material  it converts more energy than in the air  during this process  the signal strength is decreased more strongly  because the energy is transferred to the material  e.g   in heat   furthermore the signal is also reflected from the material  more about this problem is following in the section entitled problems and interferences.22 1  fundamentals for wifi measuring  the distance between the transmitter and the receiver has an important role in determining the position  in contrast to gps  wifi  at a time measurement method  does not come into question  since such an exact time is difficult to achieve synchronization  finally  the path from space to the ground is much farther than from one access point to a mobile device  the received signal strength  rss  and the signal noise ratio  snr  are the most suitable  these values can be calculated from the incoming signals  2  signal strength  the signal strength is measured in dbm  decibel in milliwatt   a wifi station has a eirp  equivalent isotropically radiated power  of 100mw  1000mw  20dbm  30dbm   this is how to calculate  p 1mw  1  100mw = 20dbm 1mw  2  lp  dbm  = 10 log for example  lp  dbm  = 10 log in general  wireless radio transmission is subject to many confounding factors  even the sun or rain drops have an effect on the signal strength  actually even if this disruptive factor is very low  it would still be measured  another problem is the electromagnetic radiation inside buildings  additionally  many walls  doors and floors have to be penetrated  the result of this is attenuation  an additional problem is the wireless overlay  in an office or apartment building  there are several dozen wireless stations that provide much interference  1  signal attenuation of static environment  usually hits an electromagnetic wave on a wall or another barrier it passes through  however  the wave becomes weaker  due to reflection that originates while striking the barrier  another part is absorbed and converted into heat  the factor of which is so small that it would not be noticeable for a human  the size of the loss is related to the material  specifically its thickness  for example  glass has a higher attenuation effect than brick walls.21 these factors are critical  especially with methods which determine a distance by the measuring of the signal strength  2  signal attenuation by user  as we can see in the experiment,13 the presence of a user changes the signal strength  this is especially important for the fingerprinting-based location method  because the mean values would be influenced by the presence of a user  when the positioning system is supposed to cater to real users  it is essential to have the user present while collecting the rss values for the fingerprint and to take into account the effect of the humans body.13 as already mentioned  wifi uses the frequencies of about 2,4 ghz  just like microwaves  the effect that is used to heat up food with a microwave is a disruptive effect with wifi  this is because the radiation is partially absorbed by the water in the human body and the signal is attenuated  iii  p ositioning t heory a topologien there are three topologies that can be used for positioning.18 this first one is called network-based  here the position is determined by the stations  which build a network  and a central server  the next is called terminal-based and identifies the position over the terminal  or mobile device   the last topology is a hybrid form of the two  an illustration can be seen in figure 3 service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012 3 urban surroundings is a wifi infrastructure guaranteed  in rural surroundings the chance for an outdoor wifi positioning system are not as good  iv  m easurement theory fig  3 network-based  terminal-based and terminal-assisted topologie 1  network-based  the network-based approach works on wifi  only when the station software is modified because the station must be able to redirect its measurement data  mostly rss and ids  beside the normal network data  the sequence looks like this  beacons of the mobile devices are received by the stations and are redirected to a central server  this server has a database and can use it to calculate the position  for almost all of the positioning methods  preparations must be made  for example  the positions of all stations with their bssids must be stored  the mobile devices do not need any software installed  instead they must just send beacons  indeed  the mobile devices do not take note of if they are located  2  terminal-based  the terminal-based approach functions exactly in the opposite way to the network-based approach  the mobile devices receive the beacons of the stations  with this  and with the information from the database  the position can be calculated  a wifi device is able  in a so-called passive mode  to wait in the background for beacons from wifi stations  and can even be connected to a station  the interval for sending beacons from a station lies at less than 10m  another possibility is the active mode  and for this the wifi device sends out beacons  and with it the station sends a reply back to the beacon  an important feature is that the mobile device  or terminal  carries the database with it  3  terminal-assisted  the terminal-assisted approach is a mix of both of the above  the beacons are received by the mobile device and the information is transferred to the central server so the database can calculate the position  b indoor and outdoor positioning the indoors and outdoors have different requirements for a wifi positioning system  the indoor environment has man disruptive factors like walls  windows  doors  and so on  a positioning system must be able to handle these problems and deliver good results  a higher accuracy is also required for the indoors because it is important to locate a user at least in the right room  a few meters can make a big difference  wifi is especially interesting for indoors because there are no other positioning services running  outdoor positioning has fewer requirements  the accuracy is not as important outdoors as it is indoors  but there are fewer environmental barriers  coverage is another problem in outdoor positioning because only in there are many different approaches for locating a mobile device using wifi technology  in the following  the method to estimate the sought position is described  in general  the methods need to know the position of the wifi stations  =access points  as a reference point that are used for the approximate position of the mobile device.7 a prerequisite for a good-working wifi positioning system is an adequate coverage of the access points  this coverage is called basic service area  bsa   the expression of the bsa determines which positioning method is the most suitable  the methods differ in the minimum required number of stations and its accuracy  this varies between building part accuracy and room accuracy to an accuracy of a few meters difference  a based on proximity sensing methods based on proximity sensing are among the simplest and fastest  but they are also imprecise  a position calculation can be done with just a single station  it is hardly possible  for example  to perform an indoor positioning that delivers the right floors in a multi-storey building  as result  one gets only the part of the building in which the mobile device is located  on the other hand  this kind of positioning is popular for outdoor positioning  1  cell identity  a relatively simple method is called cell of origin or cell identity and is based on ideas coming from a gsm positioning method  to run a positioning system using this method  some preparations must be made  a database of station ids and the geolocation is necessary  the position is determined by measuring the signal strength  it is assumed that the closest station is the station from which the strongest incoming signal on the device is received  depending on which topology is used  a request to the database is performed for the id of the station with the strongest received signal  the database returns the position of the desired station and thus the position of the device  this is because a device within range of the station has the approximate location of the station  so this method is good for short-range technologies like wifi  if this method is used with wifi as id  the bssid  basic service set identification  is used  which is a unique hardware address given to every wifi device  in this case  the mac address is used as bssid  as explained in ieee 802.11 bssid.3 by using a network-based topology  the station collects tuple from the mobile device ids and its received signal strength  and commits this information to a server that has access to the database of station locations  the server now chooses the station with the strongest signal as the position for the mobile device  by using a terminal-based or terminal-assisted topology  the mobile device can use the passive mode to scan for active wifi stations  after choosing the station with the strongest signal  a simple search in the database will return the position coordinates  however  unfortunately this information is very inaccurate  service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012 fig  4  4 cell of origin illustration  source  cisco.com  the disadvantage of this measuring method it that the size of range is variable between 25 and 200 meters  depending on the measuring occurs indoors or outdoors.2 that makes indoor positioning with this method not very attractive  indeed one could run the stations with low power  so the radius is smaller and the positioning would therefore be accurate  however  it also negatively affects the data transmission and possibly the wifi coverage  it is also an important requirement  as with many positioning methods  that the stations are fixed  if changes are made to the location of the station  the database entry needs to be corrected  this is a big problem for companies that use ci in their positioning system  because they themselves must find out if a stations location has been changed  the advantage of the method is that it is very simple and therefore a position determination is very fast  it works with at least one station summary  positioning is based on the position of the station with the stongest signal that can be received   +  can utilize existing wifi infrastructure without modifications  +  allows network and terminal-based positioning    positioning is inaccurate  +  allows real-time positioning better for outdoor positioning  b based on trilateration lateration or trilateration is the determination of absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances  using geometry  the tri in trilateration reveals that at least three fixed points are necessary to determine a position  the idea behind the geometry is that all trilateration methods start with calculating the distance from a station to a device  the distance then is used as the radius from the station  somewhere on the edge of the resulting circuit  the position of the device is assumed  to lessen the possibilities  a second group of results is also used from the measurements of another station  of course the second station has to be in the range of the device  with the radius of the second station one receives two points  if one imagines this in a geometrical way  one keeps two circles and two intersection points  one of the two points is the position of the devices  to find out which point is the right point a third station is used  an illustration of this fig  5 trilateration  source  wikipedia.org  geometry can be seen in figure 5 in the following the methods of distance determination are explained  should the localisation deliver three dimensional results which make sense  e.g  in multi-storey buildings  the additional fourth station is required to receive an unequivocal position  because the distance measurements are not very accurate it is recommended to use an error range in the circles  this compensates the measuring errors otherwise it is possible that one does not get any intersection points  the challenge for a trilateration method lies in the best possible determination of the distance between the station and the device  methods that are based on time measurements have to guarantee a good synchronisation on the stations or mobile devices  on the other hand  methods that are based on the signal strength have problems with interferences and reflection  therefore  they are probably better suitable for outdoors than for indoors  1  time of arrival  toa   with this method time is measured  which needs a signal from a station to mobile device and back again  and in this instance it is called the round trip time  rtt   a requirement for this method is synchronically running clocks  according to which topology is used  only the clocks of the stations or also the clocks of the mobile devices must run synchronically  with the measured data of the station and the given speed of the signal  it can be calculated how far away the mobile device is  indeed  no time may pass with the receiving and sending back of the signal because this would influence the measured data  as this is not possible without modification in mobile devices  this method does not function with wifi  positioning is based ontrilateration with measurements of time    at least three station in range of the device are necessary     position coordinates of station must be exact  service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012    does not work with wifi 2  time difference of arrival  tdoa   like toa  tdoa also needs exact clock synchronisation  indeed according to,6 tdoa is more popular with commercial detection systems than toa  with this method  the difference is used between the arrival times of the signals to determine the position  because wifi was never planned  nevertheless  to make such exact time measurements  is also not possible to use tdoa on wifi  positioning is based ontrilateration with measurements of time difference    at least three station in range of the device are necessary     position coordinates of station must be exact     does not work with wifi 3  received signal strength  rss   this method uses propagation-loss of the wifi signals to compute the distance.8 the decibel version of free space path loss equation is s   s is the signal strength in watts   by using 10 log  0.001 these measurements  which distance matches which signal power can be found out  this method functions relatively well outdoors  but in buildings it can come to strong divergences  because the walls reflect and attenuate the wifi signals  these methods work with the wifi technology and can be used for the localisation  one can even use all three topologies with this method  however  software must be modified with the routers network-based topology  positioning is based ontrilateration with measurements of signal strength    at least three stations in range of the device are necessary     position coordinates of station must be exact   +  does work with wifi  +  works well outdoors    works indoors but doesnt deliver accurate values  +  supports all topologies the method signal to noise ratio  snr  is neglected here because it usually provides poorer results than rss  only the fact that it exists should be mentioned  it works on the same principle  but instead of transmitting power  the measured interference is used  5 c based on triangulation 1  angle of arrival  aoa  in this method  the angle of the arriving signals is determined and  using geometry  the position can be determined  at least two stations in reach of the mobile devices are a requirement for aoa  it is suitable for indoor and outdoor positioning and it can measure in real time  the estimation of the angle has an inaccuracy of only 2 degrees.17 aoa is not applicable without modification of the hardware  but it returns good results  special antennas are mandatory for the determination of the location with the angle of arrival method  these antennas must be able to measure the phaseshift of incoming signals  therefore it is best to use directional antennas or a multiple antenna array  the direction can be determined with the tdoa  time difference of arrival   this refers to the array antennas  when a signal hits the antenna at fig  6 illustation of a single array antenna that receives a signal  fig  7 a special directional wifi antenna determine the position with aoa  the right angle  the tdoa is equal to zero  in all other cases the signal hits the part of the antenna first that has the smallest distance to the source of the signal  the time difference of the receiving on the next part of the antenna is measured  and thus the angle can be calculated  with the triangulation technique it is possible to calculate the position of the mobile device  due to the determination of the incident angle on the receiving sensor of the station  from the geometrical view  a line goes out in the calculated angle from the antenna  if this is made with all the stations standing at possession  an intersection originates  this is shown in figure 8 as a reference value  the position  like with all methods  must be confessed2  this approach works well with wifi  but  as already mentioned  the hardware must be modified  as it would be extremely complicated to equip mobile devices afterwards with an array of antennas  unfortunately one can not measure from which direction the signal from the station comes  therefore two topologies are omitted  terminalassisted and terminal based  now the network-based topology is the only one remaining  in practice it would be in such a way that the stations tuple with mobile device id  and that the angle  or the tdoa data  is sent to a central server and this calculates the positions  summary  position

fingerprinting  also called location patterning  uses a previously created database of signal patterns  which need to be matched for positioning only  fingerprinting doesnt need modification of the hardware like  for example  aoa  furthermore  no time synchronisation is necessary between the stations  before a position can be determined  the entire area in which the positioning is supposed to work must be recorded  this happens in phase 1  the socalled calibration-phase  offline-phase or training-phase  the area in which the positioning should later run  must be covered with a pattern of recording points  called fingerprints  step by step  for every fingerprint there must be a measurement  that includes the information about all stations and their received signal strength  rss   each fingerprint is a vector r  associated with each element of a station  the number of stations must be known and may be changed only if the measurement is repeated from phase 1 the collected data is stored in a database  called a radio map  so that it can be retrieved later in phase 2 that is the actual position determination phase  if a mobile device should be located in the recorded area  then it measures the signal strengths of all the current stations in range  it is the actual position determination phase  if a mobile device should be located in the recorded area  then it measures the rss of all the current stations in range  this data will be stored in the comparative vector p now the euclidean distance between p and the rs on the radio map is calculated  the chance to have chosen the right place is greatest where the euclidean distance is smallest  the disadvantage of this method is that there must be a lot of complex preparation before the system works.15 as we read in18 rss strongly depends on line-of sight  so to improve the system every measurement should add additional information about the direction  this takes longer in phase 1 but delivers better results in phase 2 the table shows an example of such a radio map  fingerprinting can be used with all three topologies  with a network-based system every position is sent to the station with mobile device beacons  as usual  with network-based attempts  the software of the station must be customised  so that the signal information can be extracted  if the information is in the central server this can calculate the position  the advantage with this topology is that devices that dont usually have wifi can also be located  for example  a wheelchair  when a wifi badge or a wifi tag device  without any real function except sending beacons  can be attached to this device  this enables it to be found in the building anytime  later we will to talk about a company  called ekahau  that uses this strategy  on the terminal-based approaches  there are no great characteristics  so this topic is not taken up here again  the functionality has already been explained in the preceding chapter  it is also interesting that the position of the station does not need to be known  only the position of the fingerprints must be known  so that the type of coordinates used can be chosen  it would  for example  be possible to use the geographic coordinate system or our own coordinates of the building area  finger printing can be used indoors as well as outdoors like this experiment shows.19 position determination with rss pattern   +  needs no hardware modifications  +  indoor and outdoor    only network-based  +  very good accuracy    creating a radio map is consuming v i mproving of p ositioning d etermination a hidden markov model the hidden markov model is a statistical model in which a system can be modelled  it allows the system to integrate the likelihood of a movement or positional change  to integrate a hidden markov model in a positioning system  a pattern of nodes must be laid over the area  just like in fingerprinting  a node corresponds to a position and is connected bidirectionally to the edges of other nodes  at each of these edges the likelihood for the transition to the next node is attached  mistakes like jumping through walls or floors can therefore be reduced  we can see this

a skyhook wireless skyhook wireless is a company from boston  usa  that collect wifi and location data  their most famous customer is apple  who use the wifi location data to determine positions without real gps on the iphone  they also offer a sdk for wifi positioning that is available for free and is especially valuable for mobile software developers  like google  skyhook wireless has a collection of wifi stations and positions them by using cars that go through the cities and streets  which is called wardrivering.9 skyhook give an accuracy of 10-20 meters  according to their website  to get the best results they use xps  the hybrid positioning system  it uses gps  cell towers and wifi-measurements for position determination  due to this architecture  they are able to provide a time to fix under 1 second  the database of skyhook wireless includes the locations of over 250 million wifi access points and cellular towers  b ekahau 2000 ekahau was founded in helsinki as a spin-off from the university of helsinki  now the headquarters is in the usa  ekahau offers real time wifi positioning systems for companies  especially for hospitals  the system works both indoors and outdoors  a whole range of wifi enabled devices are available  for example  small wifi devices  like a watch  for locating patients or others to send a help signal or to call a nurse  the advantage of this wifi positioning system is that it can use the existing infrastructure of 802.11 a/b/g/n stations  the tracking algorithms is patented with 7 patents for positioning  it uses the hidden markov model  signal strength and signal value bit error rate.11 that allows ekahau to offer a good working positioning solution  in january 2005  navizon was founded  just like skyhook  they

aeroscout vii  c onclusion wifi has become a widespreading technology  a technology that has never been designed for localization  nevertheless  wifi positioning performs well in comparison to other positioning technologies  and has the favourable advantage that it is based on an existing infrastructure  first  it can be said that all wifi agreed methods are based on signal strength  except aoa   methods that are based on timing can not be realized with wifi  so the techniques toa and tdoa were not agreed by wifi  the technique best suited for each individual wifi positioning is dependant on the environment  when indoors  positioning fingerprinting delivers the best results  however  it is also associated with a lot of effort  with a hidden markov model the accuracy can be increased even further  the angle of arrival is also a good opportunity  unfortunately  this requires special hardware and the localizations can only be network-based  for indoor positioning ci or rss gives inaccurate values  outdoor wifi has a smaller benefit  mostly because gps provides better results  however  there are outdoors areas  where gps can not perform  then wifi positioning is a good alternative  a further advantage is that wifi is faster than gps at the beginning with finding the position  the gps module used in mobile devices usually needs a lot of power  and by switching onto wifi positioning it can use the already switched on wifi to determine its position  a system based on ci is fast and easy to build up  rss is also well suited for outdoors and delivers even better results  aoa systems are probably not profitable for larger areas  but they do give good results  fingerprinting can also be used outdoors  in this case  the use of directional data will improve the accuracy of the results  service-centric networking  seminar ws2011/2012 r eferences  1  elliott d kaplan  christopher j hegarty understanding gps  principles and applications  3rd ed  london  england
