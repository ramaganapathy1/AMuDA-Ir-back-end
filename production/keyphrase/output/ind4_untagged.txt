radio frequency identification  rfid  and other wireless technologies lies at the heart of many emerging applications  such as remote medicine  robotic teams  wireless sensing  early warning systems  e.g  for tsunamis  earthquakes  chemical spills  etc    locating points of interests  e.g  atms  banks  hospitals  etc    and automated inventory management  abowd and mynatt  2000 ; hightower and borriello  2001 ; mattern  2001 ; satyanarayanan  2001 ; estrin et al  2002 ; romer and domnitcheva  2002 ; vogt  2002 ; fontelo et al  2003 ; schilit  2003 ; merrell et al  2005 ; muthukrishnan et al  2005 ; romer et al  2005 ; blewitt et al  2006 ; liu et al  2006 ; wang et al  2007 ; want  2008   such applications require capabilities that include real-time object identification  object tracking  and position localisation  while typical rfid technology is sufficient for object tracking  i.e  registering the presence/absence of an object in a radio field  and identification  i.e  matching an onboard rfid tag id with a trusted database   it does not normally provide object localisation capabilities  i.e  precisely locating the position of an object   several rfidbased localisation techniques for stationary and mobile objects have been proposed  ni et al  2003 ; alippi et al  2006 ; senta et al  2007 ; milella et al  2009   however  these techniques tend to compromise key requirements such as accuracy  speed  cost  scalability  and reliability  thus severely degrading the utility of these methods  moreover  some previous localisation methods also require cumbersome non-rfid technologies such as ultrasonic sensors  vision sensors  cameras  and lasers  which again make them unsuitable for practical use in typical environments  we address these limitations by developing a scalable and reliable rfid-based localisation framework that accurately and rapidly determines the positions of stationary and mobile objects  our approach consists of separate techniques to localise target tags  as well as localise readers attached to mobile objects  to localise stationary and mobile target tags  we vary the reader power levels over a set of calibrated reference tags having known sensitivities  separately  we determine the positions of target mobile readers by measuring their proximity to known reference tags  moreover  these two approaches can be combined to yield even higher accuracy and efficiency  we implemented  tested  and evaluated the proposed approach to confirm its general applicability  scalability  and reliability  our approach suits a wide range of requirements and trade-offs including accuracy  speed  and cost  we have also identified several key challenges  e.g  environmental interferences  tag sensitivity  spatial arrangement of tags  etc   that adversely affect the performance of rfid-based object localisation  and we propose mitigating techniques  this paper is organised as follows  section 2 describes related research work in rfid-based object localisation  we formulate the problem of object localisation using rfid in section 3 section 4 presents several localisation challenges and mitigating techniques  we describe our object localisation framework in section 5  and discuss the experimental evaluation and results in section 6 section 7 outlines key lessons learned  and section 8 concludes with future research directions  4 2 k chawla and g robins related work recent advances in ubiquitous computing have necessitated rfid-based object localisation capabilities  with research efforts specifically targeting the positioning of either stationary or mobile objects  rfid-based localisation techniques can be broadly classified as reader and tag-based approaches  in reader-based localisation techniques  the positions of rfid readers are ascertained  while in tag-based localisation techniques  the positions of rfid tags are determined  note that rfid tags and readers can each be either stationary or mobile  in this paper  we focus on pure-rfid object localisation techniques  utilising only the interaction between rfid readers and tags  i.e  other rf-based approaches utilising near-field propagation  surface acoustic waves  microwaves  cameras  ultrasonics  etc  are outside the scope of this work  and arguably are not as useful in many rfid scenarios   existing rfid-based stationary object localisation techniques are described below  ni et al   2003  propose placing active reference tags and determining the euclidean distance between the reference and the target tags  k-nearest reference tags are used to determine the position estimates of a target tag  with a maximum localisation error of less than two metres  alippi et al   2006  model the indoor localisation problem as a nonlinear stochastic inversion problem  their experimental 2d environment has multiple readers at fixed locations and tags at unknown locations  data is gathered using multiple antennas at different orientations  a conditional probability-based model is used  wherein tag detection probabilities vary at different power levels  yielding an average localisation error of 0.68 metres  bekkali et al   2007  use two mobile readers  a probabilistic rfid map  and a kalman filter-based technique to minimise the localisation error variance  position estimates of the target tags are determined using a received signal strength indicator  rssi  -based metric  and a probability density function generates the probability map for each reference tag  the localisation error of this approach has a root mean square in the range of 0.5 to 1 metres  joho et al   2009  develop a probabilistic sensor model based on the tag rssi measurement  the antenna orientation  and tag location  a mobile reader moves through the environment to gather tag measurements and correlates them with the true locations  multiple iterations are required to improve the tag position estimates  resulting in an average localisation error of 0.375 metres  zhang et al   2007  introduce the concept of virtual tags and a proximity map  their key idea is to consider the presence of virtual tags with the reference tags  the rssi values of virtual tags from each reader are calculated using a linear interpolation algorithm  different proximity maps are generated for each reader  and the intersection of these maps is used to determine the location of the target tags  the localisation error of this approach is in the range of 0.14 to 0.29 metres  wang et al   2007  propose a 3d tag positioning scheme  wherein reference tags are placed either on the floor or ceiling and at least four readers are placed on the vertices of a hexahedron  readers gradually increase their transmission power until responses are received from the reference and target tags  statistical averaging and the simplex method are used to reduce the localisation error to a range of 0.1 to 0.9 metres  but at the cost of high hardware expense and long positioning times  choi and lee  2009  study the characteristics of a passive uhf rfid system and propose an rssi-based localisation an rfid-based object localisation framework 5 approach using passive tags  the k-nearest neighbours algorithm is utilised to compute the differences of the rssi-based metric of various reference tags in order to localise a single target tag  with an average localisation error of 0.21 metres  hekimian-williams et al   2010  utilise the phase difference of the signals received at two separate antennas to localise the active tags  additionally  they make use of software-defined radios coupled with accurately sampled clocks to implement various phase difference estimation algorithms  thus  clock precision is an important factor in determining the localisation accuracy  while their system yields high accuracy under ideal conditions  they do not take into account key factors such as multi-path scattering and tag sensitivity  jin et al   2006  propose to improve the localisation accuracy of the landmarc system  ni et al  2003  by selecting only a few reference tags that have the least distance from a target tag  they utilise multiple readers to localise the target tags to within an average localisation accuracy of 0.72 metres  zhang et al   2007  propose using the direction of arrival of tag responses in order to localise the target tags  simulations indicate an average localisation error of 1 metre  however  the effects of multi-path scattering  environmental interferences  and tag sensitivity variations are not considered  some rfid-based positioning techniques are specifically designed to localise mobile objects  as opposed to stationary ones   for example  chae and han  2005  propose a two-step approach to localise mobile robots in an indoor environment  in their first step  an onboard rfid reader is coarsely localised with respect to neighbourhood active reference tags  in the second step  a vision sensor combined with a feature detection algorithm identifies key environmental features to minimise the average localisation error to 0.23 metres  their approach is less applicable in different scenarios since the onboard vision sensor requires a sufficiently illuminated environment and objects must be within line-of-sight  a fundamental drawback that rfid technology was intended to eliminate in the first place   choi and lee  2009  propose to localise mobile robots in an indoor environment by utilising ultrasonic sensors in combination with an onboard reader  their localisation approach has two stages  in the first stage  the global position of the mobile robot is estimated through onboard reader localisation with respect to the neighbourhood passive reference tags  the second stage uses ultrasonic sensors for local position estimates  while their approach can yield higher accuracy  it is inherently not a pure rfid-based method  but rather a sound-based approach and is thus highly limited by issues such as environmental noise  line-of-sight  echoes  etc  hhnel et al   2004  propose a laser range scanner combined with an rfid reader onboard a mobile robot  the laser range scanner is used to learn a map comprised of reference tags  which in turn is used to estimate the position and orientation of mobile robots  however  this approach imposes line-of-sight constraints  and moreover tag orientation issues degrade the detection probability of the reference tags  resulting in high localisation errors in the 1 to 10 metres range  han et al   2007  propose a mobile object localisation technique by using reference tags and onboard mobile readers  they show that the particular spatial arrangement of tags affects the localisation error and propose a triangular tag arrangement scheme to minimise it  their approach yields an average localisation error of 0.09 metres in a small test region of one metre square  6 k chawla and g robins milella et al   2009  utilise an onboard monocular camera  a reader and a tag bearing estimation technique based on a fuzzy inference system to localise mobile robots to within an average error of 0.64 metres  senta et al   2007  present a mobile robot localisation technique based on reference tags  onboard readers  and a support vector machine  svm  -based machine learning approach  this method yields localisation errors of over 0.2 metres  and is limited by the tag spatial arrangement  measurement noise  and tag-reader proximity  seo and lee  2008  describe a mobile object localisation system that transmits an rfid signal from an onboard reader to the neighbourhood beacon  which in return responds with an ultrasonic signal  the estimated distance is computed based on the time difference between transmitted and received signals  with an average localisation error in the range of 0.2 to 1.6 metres  vorst et al   2008  present a mobile object localisation approach using reference tags  onboard readers  and a particle filter-based technique  they compare prior-obtained training data with real-time rfid measurements to yield an average localisation error in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 metres  currently  the effectiveness of several of the previous approaches is hindered by reliance on line-of-sight techniques  combining multiple non-rfid  e.g  ultrasonic sensors  cameras  lasers  etc   and rfid components in an ad-hoc manner  large number of onboard components  and high localisation delays  chae and han  2005 ; hhnel et al  2004 ; choi and lee  2009 ; milella et al  2009   moreover  some of the above methods are too expensive or unwieldy due to the cost  size  and weight of the required infrastructure  finally  the above approaches ignore the key issue that the rfid equipment itself can introduce significant amount of experimental errors  for example  previous works ignore the fact that identical tags can have widely varying detection sensitivities  which can greatly affect the experimental outcomes  chawla et al  2010a ; chawla et al  2010b   thus  instead of addressing and mitigating these basic principles  as we do in our approach   previous research works resort to herculean efforts in order to reduce the errors on other fronts  while ignoring bigger error sources  resulting in a hodgepodge of ad-hoc and sometimes ineffectual techniques  3 problem statement  object localisation using rfid we address the problem of localising stationary and mobile objects by utilising only rfid-based technology  as opposed to relying on non-rfid technology such as lasers  ultrasonic sensors  cameras  etc   in this section  we describe the underlying principles of the proposed approach and the key performance parameters for optimisation  rfid-based object localisation requires determining the positions of stationary and mobile objects affixed with tags and/or readers  radio signal properties such as power-distance relationships can ascertain these locations  theoretically  the radio waves power-distance relationship can be characterised based on the friis transmission equation as follows  finkenzeller  2003   pr = gr gt pt 4 d 2  1  here  pr is the power transmitted by the reader  pt is the power received at the tag  gr and gt are the respective antenna gains of the reader and the tag  is the radio wave wavelength  and d is the distance between the tag and reader  for a typical rfid system  an rfid-based object localisation framework 7 variables such as  gr and gt are some of the main design parameters  thus  by knowing the power levels at the reader and the tag  the distance between them can be estimated  alternatively  if the distance between the readers and tags are known  then the received power level at the tags can be determined  thus  our overall rfid localisation strategy is as follows  we slowly increase the readers power level from low to high in small increments  when a given tag becomes detectable to a reader for the first time  the power level at which this first detection event happens indicates the tags distance from that reader  as different readers perform such readings  from different directions   the tags position can be estimated with increasing accuracy by considering the intersections of these detection regions  figure 1 illustrates a shared region induced by the geometric intersections of the radio wave lobes used to detect a tag by several readers  such intersection regions  if small enough in size  can help minimise the error in position when estimating the locations of target objects using reference tags  i.e  regions overlapped by more radio wave lobes have a smaller area than other more peripheral regions covered by fewer lobes  resulting in increased localisation accuracy   note  however  that this intuitive intersection-ofregions analogy is only a conceptual explanatory tool  our system does not explicitly compute geometrical regions  nor is it even particularly aware of geometry in general  rather  our system compares the detection power levels of target tags with those of known reference tags  in order to infer the target tags position  in other words  our approach is relativised in that it tries to match the behaviours of known and unknown tags  under the key assumption that if the behaviours and responses of two tags are very similar  then their positions must be very close as well  figure 1 a shared region induced by the intersection of radio wave lobes rfid antenna intersection region radio wave at first glance it may seem contradictory that a positioning system can be mostly oblivious to geometrical considerations  however  because of all the real-world factors that interfere with accurate rf transmission and reception  correlating a complex geometry with precise levels of rf receptivity is difficult  our system sidesteps these complicated issues by ignoring the geometry  and instead takes a pragmatic relative approach by observing and comparing behaviours rather than trying to accurately predict them  note that such an empirical approach naturally adapts and automatically calibrates to unknown conditions and unexpected effects  since these would presumably affect  identical  target and reference tags in a very similar way  thus  the geometry-obliviousness feature of our system is not a weakness but rather a deliberate capability that yields performance advantages  8 k chawla and g robins in real-world scenarios  various ad-hoc interfering factors  e.g  environmental conditions  multi-path scattering  and rf occlusions due to liquids and metals  etc   affect signal strengths and received power levels  moreover  variability in detection sensitivities across identical tags poses a unique challenge in reliably establishing and leveraging the empirical power-distance relationship  to understand the implications of this variability  consider two tags of the same type  e.g  impinj dogbone monza 3 uhf passive tag  having different sensitivities  due to manufacturing variations   these tags  when kept at the same fixed location from the reader  will be initially detected at different reader power levels  thereby skewing the observed empirical powerdistance relationship  our proposed object localisation framework considers these challenges and takes the pragmatic approach of only using uniformly sensitive reference tags to establish the empirical power-distance relationship  section 5.1 below will discuss this sensitivity analysis in greater detail  4 localisation challenges as discussed above  all rfid-based object localisation techniques have inherent position estimate errors due to various external  e.g  environmental interferences  and internal  e.g  rfid tags and reader related  factors  this section describes several key challenges that could induce localisation errors and our proposed techniques to mitigate them  4.1 interference and rf occlusion environmental factors such as radio noise and occlusions by liquids or metals  which tend to be opaque to rf signals  can cause radio wave scattering and attenuation  which in turn can result in localisation errors  mitigating techniques such as electrostatic shielding  full faraday cycle analysis  and path-loss contour mapping can help reduce the impact of such factors on localisation accuracy  sweeney  2005   deploying more tags and readers in the region of interest can also reduce adverse effects due to interferences and occlusions  4.2 tag sensitivity tag detection sensitivity is characterised by the minimum power needed to read the tag at a particular distance  it is a function of chip threshold power sensitivity  tag antenna gain  and chips high impedance state  nikitin and rao  2008   moreover  tag manufacturing variability can dramatically affect the detection sensitivities of tags  thus  tags with low sensitivities become invisible at shorter distances than their higher sensitivity counterparts  leading to localisation errors  to address this issue  we propose a pre-processing step of sorting  i.e  binning  the tags based on their detection sensitivities  we thus classify tags as highly sensitive  average sensitive  and low sensitive using read measurements over different power and distance combinations  chawla et al  2010a ; chawla et al  2010b   as detailed in section 5 below  this enables only uniformly sensitive tags to be deployed in the same experiment  resulting in more consistent and meaningful experimental results  curiously  previous works all seem to ignore this critical issue  an rfid-based object localisation framework 9 4.3 tag spatiality rfid-based object localisation techniques typically utilise reference tags placed at known locations  the positions and arrangements of these reference tags can significantly affect the localisation accuracy  regular placements of the reference tags  as opposed to random arrangements  tend to yield lower positioning errors  han et al  2007   4.4 tag orientation tag orientation significantly affects tag and reader interaction  for example  bolotnyy and robins  2007a  2007b  2009  analysed how tag orientation impacts the tag detection probability  in particular  they discovered that when multiple tags are placed on the same object  orthogonal orientations yield much higher detection probabilities than parallel orientations  figure 2a  shows a 3d object with multiple orthogonally oriented rfid tags  figure 2b shows orthogonal planar  i.e  horizontal and vertical  orientations of two tags  in section 5  our experiments indicate that horizontal planar orientations increase the tags sensitivity  thus  utilising multiple tags in orthogonal spatial and horizontal planar orientations tends to improve the overall localisation accuracy  figure 2 tag orientations  a  3d orthogonal  b  planar orthogonal 4.5 reader locality theoretically  the usable power in the radio waves emitted by the reader attenuates inversely proportional to the cube  for near-field  and square  for far-field  of the distance  as given by the friis transmission equation   this determines the operating/ detection region for the tags with respect to the readers  thus  the readers location and proximity to a tag impacts the tags localisation accuracy  we propose that more tags should be placed in regions likely to be nearer to the objects being localised in order to improve the overall localisation accuracy  the main guiding principle behind all the above mitigating techniques is to identify and minimise possible errors at the sources where they arise  this leads to efficient localisation techniques  fewer onboard components  higher localisation accuracy and speed  in the following section  we use this principle with the proposed object localisation framework to improve the localisation accuracy and speed  10 k chawla and g robins 5 object localisation framework the proposed localisation approach utilises two different techniques  in the first technique  an onboard reader and reference tags embedded in the environment are used to coarsely localise the mobile object  the second technique varies the power levels of environment-embedded readers to localise the onboard tag via the empirical powerdistance relationship  calibrated using reference tags at known positions   to ensure uniform behaviour from the tags  we test  sort  and select them based on their  similar  detection sensitivity  also  by employing multi-tags  bolotnyy and robins  2007a ; bolotnyy and robins  2007b ; bolotnyy and robins  2009   we reduce the uncertainties when inferring tag positions  finally  we combine these localisation techniques and propose several heuristics for significantly improving the localisation accuracy  while tags are sorted  placed  and calibrated as part of an offline pre-processing phase  the actual localisation and error minimisation heuristics are performed in real time  the calibration process may be repeated occasionally  in order to adjust the system to varying environmental conditions  re-calibration may also be performed in parallel with actual localisation operations to accommodate drifts in the empirical power-distance relationship  below we describe key aspects of the proposed localisation approach  5.1 tag sensitivity analysis tag manufacturing variability can dramatically affect the detection sensitivity of tags  i.e  the minimum reader power level needed to successfully read a tag at a given location   in fact  a small fraction of any commercially obtained batch of tags are typically even dead  i.e  non-functional  altogether  while the localisation speed will increase with higher tag sensitivities  the accuracy of the proposed localisation framework depends on the uniform detection sensitivities of the tags  thus  an offline pre-processing qualitycontrol check provides a characterisation of the sensitivities to ensure that only tags with uniform  and reasonably high  sensitivities contribute to our subsequent localisation experiments  our experimental evaluation showed that tag sensitivity varied considerably across a group of 243 tags of the same type  we have characterised the tag sensitivities based on the read counts under different reader power levels and distance combinations  thus  given a fixed reader power level  if a tag has low read counts among its peers  we call it low sensitive  similarly  tags with high read counts are labelled as highly sensitive  and tags having equal read count are called average sensitive  we performed two experiments to quantify single tag sensitivities by varying the power levels and distances between the readers and the tags  while these experiments use epc gen2 passive tags  this tag binning approach is equally applicable to other types of rfid tags  5.1.1 single tag calibration in this experiment  a batch of four tags was placed at a distance of 2.54 metres from the reader  we varied the reader power level from 25.6 dbm to 31.6 dbm  in steps of 3 dbm  we recorded the cumulative read counts of each tag for 60 seconds  i.e  3 read iterations lasting 20 seconds each   we found that 114 out of 243 tags had cumulative read counts of zero at 25.6 dbm  while remaining tags had read counts in the range of 3 to 9  some an rfid-based object localisation framework 11 tags had read counts as high as 10   moreover  at a reader power level of 28.6 dbm  most of the tags had cumulative read counts in the range 6 to 11  and the cumulative read counts ranged between 5 and 11 at 31.6 dbm  we labelled tags as low sensitive only if they had zero cumulative read counts at a power level of 25.6 dbm  also  tags were labelled as low sensitive at 28.6 dbm only if they were also labelled as low sensitive at 25.6 dbm  similarly  we labelled tags as highly sensitive at 25.6 dbm only if they were also labelled as highly sensitive at 31.6 dbm  while the combination of power levels and distance ranges was comparatively small  variations in tag sensitivities were evident even at this scale  using this process  89 out of 243 tags were classified as highly sensitive  133 tags ranked as average sensitive  and the remaining tags were considered to be low sensitive  and some tags were dead altogether   thus  this experiment classified 243 tags into three sensitivity categories based on the reader power levels required to detect them  similarly  in another set of experiments  we kept the reader power level constant and varied the distance between the tags and the reader with the same increments as above  this process classified 61 out of the 243 tags as low sensitive  161 tags as average sensitive  and 21 tags as highly sensitive  we then combined the outcomes of these two sensitivity experiments by taking the intersection of the average sensitive tag sets from each experiment  thus classifying 133 tags as overall average sensitive  in the ensuing localisation experiments  we selected all the reference and target tags from this overall average sensitive tag set  we also constructed four-way multi-tag platforms  made from the average sensitive tags that provide higher operational reliability  see the work  bolotnyy and robins  2007a ; bolotnyy and robins  2007b ; bolotnyy and robins  2009  for a more detailed analysis of multi-tags and their advantages over ordinary tags  figure 3 illustrates the design of our four-way multi-tag platform consisting of four impinj dogbone monza 3 uhf passive tags having overall average sensitivity  mounted on a vertical stand made of lego bricks  our choice of lego components is based on the versatility of lego bricks as well as the transparency of their plastic material to radio waves   we built 33 such multi-tag platforms  and each tag on these platforms was calibrated separately according to the power-distance relationship discussed above  chawla et al  2010a ; chawla et al  2010b   following our usual abundance of caution philosophy  we performed two extensive platform calibration experiments to ensure uniform detection sensitivity for the entire multi-tag platform across such variables as tag rotation and reader proximity  these experiments are described in more detail below  figure 3 a four-way multi-tag platform constructed using lego bricks 12 k chawla and g robins 5.1.2 multi-tag calibration in this calibration experiment  we ensured that the four-way multi-tag platforms consisting of four proximate equally sensitive tags all have similar sensitivities  this goal was achieved by determining the average read count of constituent tags having matching orientations with respect to the readers antennas  thus  tags at position one  two  three  and four were oriented towards antenna one  two  three  and four  respectively  we kept the reader power level constant at 31.6 dbm and varied the distance between the reader and the multi-tag platform within the range of 1.27 to 3.81 metres  we also varied the reader power level within the range of 25.6 to 31.6 dbm  keeping the distance between them constant at 2.54 metres  we repeated this calibration experiment three times and computed the average  we also analysed the sensitivity of multi-tags with respect to rotation  using similar power and distance combinations as above  we measured the average read counts of each multi-tag in each of the four possible 90-degree rotations  these experiments showed that aside from minor variations in average read counts  possibly due to the long oval shape of the radio wave lobe emitted by the readers antenna   all multi-tags performed uniformly with respect to distance  power level  and rotation  in conclusion  these experiments show that combining individually calibrated average-sensitive tags results in equally sensitive multi-tags  on a philosophical note  while this outcome is happily the expected one  we still followed sound scientific method principles and carefully verified this hypothesis experimentally  this kind of careful  methodical controlled experimentation is not wasted effort  since it sometimes can uncover startling and unexpected facts  such as the huge variance in sensitivity of ostensibly identical commercial tags discussed above  5.2 localisation algorithms we now describe our proposed localisation algorithms for estimating positions of stationary and mobile objects  5.2.1 tag localisation algorithm i  linear search the first localisation algorithm linearly increments the reader power level from lowest to highest in order to determine the minimum power level required to detect a tag  while this approach finds the minimum tag detection power level  it may take some time to converge due to the linear step-wise power incrementing approach  alternatively  we can instead vary the power level from highest to lowest in order to detect tags  since tags are typically not located very near the readers  but rather farther away from them  thus  stepping down the power level  i.e  from highest to lowest  will tend to lower the average number of iterations required to determine the minimum tag detection power level  we call this algorithm linear search and outline its pseudo-code in figure 4 an rfid-based object localisation framework figure 4 13 tag localisation algorithm i  linear search input  unique tag id tagid power varying step powerstep power varying direction powerdirection output  minimum power level power  minpower required to detect tag tagid if  powerdirection = lowtohigh  then power = minpowerlevel repeat if  power > maxpowerlevel  then return notfound end set reader power level to power search for tags until successful or time-out if  tagid is found  then return power end power = power + powerstep end else power = maxpowerlevel minpower = maxpowerlevel repeat if  power < 0  then return notfound end set reader power level to power search for tags until successful or time-out if  tagid is found  then minpower = power else return minpower end power = power powerstep end end we control the power level step using the input parameter powerstep  the direction of reader power level increment  e.g  from lowest to highest  is controlled using the input parameter powerdirection  at each power level  a single tag having the unique tag id  specified by the input parameter tagid  is searched until either it is found  or else a search timeout occurs  thus  given a set of tags to be found this linear search algorithm operates in a serial manner  to determine the minimum tag detection power levels for each given tag  this algorithm provides highly accurate tag detection power level  at the possible expense of longer overall running times  due to the additional number of rfid read operations that may be required   14 k chawla and g robins 5.2.2 tag localisation algorithm ii  binary search in the second localisation algorithm  we start at a mid-value power level  and then step-up or step-down the power  based on the readers ability to detect any tags at that stage  this binary search-based approach will tend to converge faster on the minimum power levels required to detect tags  we control the direction of the power level increment by using the variable tagfound  figure 5 depicts this proposed binary search algorithm  figure 5 tag localisation algorithm ii  binary search input  unique tag id tagid power varying step powerstep output  minimum tag detection power level tagpower tagpower = maxpowerlevel + 1 tagfound = false repeat power =  minpowerlevel + maxpowerlevel  / 2 set reader power level to power search for tags until successful or time-out if  tagid is found  then tagfound = true if  tagpower > power  then tagpower = power end end if  tagfound  then maxpowerlevel = power else minpowerlevel = power end if   maxpowerlevel minpowerlevel   powerstep  then return tagpower end end when the minimum and maximum power levels differ by only the power step size  we return the tag detection power levels  using the variable tagpower   while the binary search algorithm searches for tags in an exponentially converging manner  as opposed to linearly   it requires less time to terminate than the linear search algorithm  however  the power level resolution for binary search algorithm is sometimes less accurate than that of the linear search approach  which uses a finer-granularity power step size increment  thus  the binary search algorithm trades off run time against accuracy in the minimum tag detection power level  5.2.3 tag localisation algorithm iii  parallel search the linear search and the binary search algorithms search for only a single tag per execution cycle  i.e  they operate in a serial manner   our third algorithm addresses this limitation by determining the minimum tag detection power levels in parallel  for all the an rfid-based object localisation framework 15 tags in the readers vicinity  this parallel search strategy is analogous to running the linear search algorithm in parallel for all the tags  figure 6 illustrates this parallel search algorithm  which takes as input  through the parameter tagidset  a set of tags to be found and returns the minimum tag detection power levels  via the variable powerset   a key step in this algorithm is determining which tags have reached their optimal minimum detection power level by checking the power levels of tags whose detectabilities have not changed for a given number of iterations  figure 6 tag localisation algorithm iii  parallel search input  set of unique tags tagidset power varying step powerstep output  set of minimum tag detection power levels powerset set all tags in tagidset to maxpowerlevel power = maxpowerlevel repeat till power 0 set reader power level to power search for tags until successful or time-out update power levels in powerset for all detected tags in tagidset check for tags in tagidset with no power level update in powerset power = power powerstep end return powerset note that the underlying rfid equipment and protocols are already designed to detect/read multiple tags in a single read phase  including collision resolution   we thus rely on the embedded rfid hardware functionality to achieve the required parallelism  i.e  the simultaneous detection of many tags in a single reader operation   the proposed parallel search algorithm sweeps from the highest to lowest power levels  since more tags tend to be farther away from a given reader than closer to it  since parallel search can determine the minimum power levels of many tags in parallel  it enables the simultaneous localisation of multiple stationary and mobile objects  resulting in faster overall run times  5.2.4 reader localisation algorithm  measure and report while the previous algorithms localise tags attached to the objects  our fourth algorithm uses readers located onboard the objects themselves  in order to estimate their positions  in particular  we detect and record the unique tag ids encountered by an object along a motion path  we associate a timestamp with each such measurement  resulting in a list of tuples of the form tagid  timestamp  thus  we can determine the trajectory of the objects by knowing their proximity to the locations of reference tags  along with the measurement times  we call this algorithm measure and report  as described in figure 7  16 figure 7 k chawla and g robins reader localisation algorithm  measure and report input  unique tag id tagid output  two-tuple having unique tag id tagid and current date-time timestamp if  tagid is found  then return tagid  timestamp else return notfound end table 1 describes the runtime complexity of each algorithm  the measure and report algorithm is the fastest algorithm  while the linear search and binary search algorithms take considerably more time due to their serial manner of operation  the parallel search algorithm takes less time than either the linear search or binary search algorithm  as its run time is independent of the number of tags and only depends on the number of power levels used during the searching  table 1 time complexity of localisation algorithms localisation technique reader localisation tag localisation notes  localisation algorithm time complexity measure and report o  1  linear search o  np  binary search o  nlogp  parallel search o  p  n = number of tags  p = number of reader power levels used  moreover  the algorithms that require more time tend to generate higher resolution minimum tag detection power levels  whereas the faster algorithms trade off localisation accuracy for speed  we experiment with different combinations of these algorithms to observe the tradeoffs between localisation accuracy and running speed  furthermore  localisation errors can occur due to  a  the onboard reader operating range   b  matching the onboard target tags with the nearest reference tags  and  c  the inherent power level estimation errors of the algorithms  e.g  due to varying environmental conditions   we next discuss these errors along with mitigating techniques  5.3 error heuristics localisation errors occur in the first technique  i.e  onboard reader localisation  due to limitations in the read-range of the onboard reader  since mobile objects can move arbitrarily  an inexpensive and reliable way to reduce this type of error is by placing more densely/regularly arranged reference tags throughout the expected regions of motion  in the second technique  i.e  onboard tag localisation   errors in the position estimates can occur by identifying the onboard multi-tag with the nearest neighbourhood reference tags  an rfid-based object localisation framework figure 8 17 a source of localisation errors rfid antenna reference tag reference tag radio wave localisation error figure 8 depicts four antennas emitting radio waves  conceptually forming an intersection region where the onboard target tags may be found  in the process of matching the behaviour of an unknown tag to those of known reference tags  potential ambiguities and round off errors may occur  in order to minimise possible localisation errors  we have developed 11 error-reducing heuristics  as described in following sub-sections  5.3.1 error heuristic i  absolute difference this localisation error-reducing heuristic computes the absolute difference of the reader power levels between the neighbouring tags and the onboard tag  all of which are multitags in our experiments   we propose four such possible heuristic variants  as follows  m h1  min i  rj  j i =1  2  m m h 2  min i  rj  + i  rk  j  k ; j k i =1 i =1  3  h3  m m i  rj  + i  rk  j  k b ; j k i =1 i =1  4  h4  m m m m + < i  rk  r r s.t  r       i j i k i j j  k b ; j k i =1 i =1 i =1 i =1  5  min min 5.3.2 error heuristic ii  minimum power reader selection this error-reducing heuristic computes the absolute difference of the power levels between the neighbouring reference tags and the onboard tag using the minimum power levels of two orthogonally positioned readers  we propose two such possible heuristic variants  as follows  h 5  min j  k ; j k h6  min   t  +  t   j  k b ; j k j k   t  +  t   j k  6   7  18 k chawla and g robins 5.3.3 error heuristic iii  root sum square absolute difference this error-reducing heuristic computes the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute difference  in reader power levels  between the neighbouring reference tags and the onboard tag  we propose four such possible heuristic variants  as follows  h 7  min j m  r  i i =1 h8  min j  k ; j k h9  h10  m i i =1 j  k b ; j k j  k b ; j k  8   r  2 j m + m  r  i =1 i j 2 +  r  i =1 m 2 k m 2  r  i i =1 i  rj  + min min 2 j i i =1 m  r  i =1 i 2 k 2 k  9  s.t   10  m  r  i =1 i j 2 < m  r  i =1 i k 2  11  5.3.4 error heuristic iv  all heuristics minimum this error-reducing meta-heuristic computes the minimum over all the power levels obtained using the above heuristics  thus  this meta-heuristic yield the least tag detection power levels  denoted as follows  h11  min  h l  l  12  the variables in all the expressions above have the following denotations  t = target tag rj = reference tag j h = heuristic power = minimum detection power level for a tag m = number of readers b = set of neighbours i  r  = |power  t  power  r  | using reader i j  k = iteration variables for neighbourhood tags l = iteration variable for heuristics the above error-reducing heuristics contribute to an online post-processing step in our object localisation framework  once the minimum detection power levels of the reference and onboard tags have been determined  employing different combinations of localisation algorithms and error-reducing heuristics can achieve a desired level of accuracy  another key feature of the proposed framework is the flexibility to incorporate new localisation algorithms and error-reducing heuristics that may be developed in the future  enabling this framework to localise objects with even higher accuracy and speed  an rfid-based object localisation framework 6 19 experimental evaluation this section presents the implementation details  experimental evaluation methodology  localisation accuracy data  and run times  we also compare the proposed localisation approach with existing localisation techniques  6.1 experimental set-up we evaluated the proposed object localisation framework in an indoor environment using one reader connected to four antennas  33 reference multi-tags  one onboard reader  and one four way multi-tag platform per mobile robot that acted as either a stationary or a mobile object  we constructed two mobile robots using lego mindstorms kits  with the onboard controller being an hp ipaq hx2490 pocket pc  connected to an idtronic voltaire portable rfid reader  as shown in figure 9 figure 9 experiment components  mobile robot platform and track the lego railroad track is used to conveniently move the mobile robots along predetermined paths  also shown are the four-way multi-tag platforms used as reference tags  to localise any object/tag  we vary the stationary reader power levels to localise the onboard multi-tag  using in turn all of the localisation algorithms described above  alternatively  we also localised objects with the onboard reader to read the reference tags encountered during motion and transmit the tag ids to a backend workstation with the onboard bluetooth link  a key aspect of the proposed localisation approach is to limit the use of onboard non-rfid components  while still obtaining good localisation accuracy and speed  table 2 describes our experimental set-up and implementation details  note that the mobile robots utilising only rfid technology for localisation have somewhat bounded speed  due to the computational delays inherent in determining minimum tag detection power levels  as well as the readers operational speed  han et al  2007   thus  while mobile robots may move several metres per second while using onboard rfid readers 20 k chawla and g robins for localisation  more precise localisation requires slower speeds  such locomotion speed limitations are also present in other existing mobile object localisation techniques  we believe that as rfid technology keep advancing  faster readers  identification protocols  combined with more sophisticated tags can help achieve localisation for mobile objects moving at higher speeds  table 2 experimental set-up type backend workstation rfid equipment environment robots onboard control onboard link component cpu

6.2 experimental results we divide the proposed localisation approach into the set-up phase and the localisation phase  in the set-up phase  we instrument a 2d region with 33 reference multi-tags and determine their empirical power-distance relationships  in the localisation phase  we estimate the positions of target objects by comparing the prior-stored empirical powerdistance relationship of the reference tags with real-time measurements obtained from the onboard target tags  6.2.1 the empirical power-distance relationship in section 3  we discussed the ideal power-distance relationship based on the friis equation  we now describe our methodology for empirically determining the power-distance relationship  while accommodating various error sources  such as multi-path scattering  environmental interferences  rf occlusions  etc  figure 10 illustrates the power-distance relationship between the uniformly sensitive reference tags and the readers  we utilised the linear search algorithm to calibrate the empirical power-distance relationship  since it provides highly accurate minimum tag detection power levels  note that as the distances between the tags and readers increase  more reader power is required to detect the tags  such a relationship also implicitly determines the read-range of the reader  e.g  in illustration given in figure 10  the operating region is 4 metres long and 2 metres wide   an rfid-based object localisation framework 21 figure 10 the empirically observed power-distance relationship 6.2.2 localisation accuracy we now describe our experimental results pertaining to localisation  we utilised the proposed algorithms in different combinations during the set-up phase and the localisation phase  in order to determine which algorithm combinations yield the smallest localisation errors  in our experiments  reference tags are placed throughout the 2d experimental region at positions specified by their distances from antenna four  x-axis  and from antenna three  y-axis   as illustrated in figure 11 figure 11 a top-view of experimental set-up 4 x-axis 1 3 2 y-axis rfid antenna rfid multi-tag platform the localisation accuracy along x and y axis is depicted in figures 12a and 12b  the proposed localisation approach closely approximates  along both axes  the actual positions of target objects  we used the linear search algorithm in the set-up phase and the binary search algorithm in the localisation phase in order to yield the desired localisation accuracy  note that the parallel search algorithm and the measure and report algorithm achieve comparable accuracy with higher localisation speed  importantly  the linear search algorithm in the low-to-high mode  i.e  where the power levels are incremented from lowest to highest  provides more accurate minimum tag detection power levels  which improves the localisation accuracy  see figure 13a   22 k chawla and g robins figure 12 localisation accuracy   a  along x-axis  and  b  along y-axis  a   b  6.2.3 localisation speed localisation speed is heavily dependent on the time required to estimate minimum tag detection power levels  while the linear search algorithm  in high-to-low mode   the binary search algorithm  and parallel search algorithm all provide less accurate estimates of the minimum tag detection power levels  they also run reasonably quickly  as illustrated in figure 13b  on the other hand  the linear search algorithm in low-tohigh mode requires more time to run than the other algorithms  but is more accurate  this data confirms our hypothesis that varying the power levels from high to low is typically more efficient for localising tags farther away from the reader  i.e  where one would typically expect to find them   thus  by combining the different algorithms and their variants  appropriate application-driven trade-offs can be chosen between localisation accuracy and speed  6.2.4 power step vs localisation accuracy in section 5  we discussed the parameter powerstep which specifies the power level increment  we measured the impact of this parameter on the minimum tag detection power levels  this is accomplished by determining for a given target tag  the minimum an rfid-based object localisation framework 23 tag detection power levels using different power steps  figure 14a illustrates the minimum detection power levels of a tag for four different power steps  measured using the three localisation algorithms and two orthogonally placed antennas  linear search algorithm in low-to-high mode reports the lowest minimum tag detection power level  while parallel search yields the highest minimum tag detection power level for the same tag  since localisation accuracy is based on determining the minimum tag detection power levels  i.e  if an algorithm reports a lower minimum tag detection power level than other comparable algorithms then that algorithm yields higher accuracy   these algorithms are able to trade off accuracy and speed  figure 13 algorithmic variability   a  minimum tag detection power levels  and  b  localisation time  a   b  6.2.5 reference tag density vs localisation accuracy we hypothesised that increasing the number of reference tags increases the localisation accuracy only up to a certain point  to test this hypothesis  we varied the number of reference tags from 1 to 33 and determined that the range of localisation error varied from 1.2 to 0.2 metres  as depicted in figure 14b  thus  adding inexpensive passive reference tags increases the localisation accuracy only up to a point  for example  with only 22 reference tags  88 % of the maximum possible localisation accuracy was achieved  chawla et al  2010a ; chawla et al  2010b   24 k chawla and g robins figure 14 the impact on localisation accuracy   a  power step size  and  b  number of reference tags  a   b  6.3 comparative analysis and visualisation we now compare the proposed localisation approach to existing stationary and mobile object localisation techniques  for each proposed technique we measured separately the time required by the set-up phase and the localisation phase  table 3   curiously  most previous localisation techniques do not report either of these times  i.e  the set-up time nor the localisation time   these omissions bring into question the practicality of previous approaches  since excessive run times can severely limit the utility of a localisation method  some previous localisation techniques also heavily utilise non-rfid based components  e.g  cameras  ultrasonic sensors  lasers  etc   thus  the accuracy of such methods comes at an onerous price of resorting to cumbersome  ad-hoc combinations  and expensive technology/equipment  tending to further diminish the practicality of such methods  table 3 also reports the size of the test area  and the average localisation error  note that the maximum time required by any of the proposed localisation approaches during the set-up phase is due to the linear search algorithm operating in the low-to-high mode  however  it should be noted that the set-up phase is an offline pre-processing step that is an rfid-based object localisation framework 25 executed only infrequently  the proposed parallel search localisation approach can simultaneously localise multiple stationary and mobile objects in 1.67 minutes with an overall average accuracy of 0.35 metres  moreover  combining the different localisation algorithms in the set-up and the localisation phases can achieve a combined overall average accuracy of 0.18 metres  we believe that additional fine-tuning of our methodology can further improve these results  table 3 comparison of proposed rfid-based object localisation techniques with

low to high  hl = high to low  we also developed a visualisation tool that provides a real-time view of the object localisation environment  the visualisation user interface contains five key regions  which enable the end-users to select different error heuristics  view localisation error per location  both graphically and analytically   and control experimental variables  e.g  antenna power  reference nodes  etc   using this tool  practitioners can determine the localisation accuracy at various points in the environment  regions with low localisation accuracy can be enhanced with additional low-cost passive tags  thus  the visualisation tool  see figure 15  also serves as a feedback mechanism that can help enhance the localisation accuracy  as well as controlling the experimental testbed  26 k chawla and g robins figure 15 the visualisation user interface an rfid-based object localisation framework 7 27 key lessons learned this section outlines some key insights and lessons learned during the conceptualisation  design  and implementation of the proposed object localisation framework  7.1 calibration of tags typically  rfid-based localisation techniques use off-the-shelf tags as-is in their experiments  we have discovered that even in a brand-new batch of tags  tag sensitivities varied considerably  although previous works are surprisingly oblivious to this important issue  identifying and systematically mitigating this source of localisation errors enabled us to minimise its impact on localisation accuracy  7.2 empirical power-distance relationship while the ideal power-distance relationship can be described using  e.g  the friis transmission equation  factors such as multi-path scattering  environmental interferences  rf occlusions and variability in tag sensitivities can substantially skew this relationship  nevertheless  the power-distance relationship can be reliably characterised by direct empirical calibration measurements  rendering moot many of the unpredictable and hard-to-characterise variabilities  7.3 simplicity in algorithmic design we emphasised simplicity  i.e  occams razor  in designing the localisation algorithms and error heuristics yielding effective and efficient techniques  our streamlined methods can be implemented with relatively little overhead  using widely available commercial rfid equipment  7.4 tag orientation and placement strategies tag orientation and placement are key factors that impact effective detection  moreover  multi-tags have superior detection sensitivities over ordinary single tags  we experimentally determined the preferable  multi  tag orientations and placement strategies  e.g  orthogonal orientations yield higher detection probabilities   7.5 minimise onboard components while designing the rfid testbed mobile platforms  we focused on simplifying the onboard components and avoiding non-rfid components  in order to reduce the overall complexity  the resulting object localisation framework is efficient  robust  scalable  and economically viable  7.6 visualisation and control tools we designed a graphical user interface to visualise the operation  performance  and localisation accuracy of the experimental environment  this gui enabled the quick identification of various issues  including the identification  and enhancement  of low-accuracy regions  the discovery of improved tag placement strategies  etc  28 k chawla and g robins 7.7 application scenarios the proposed object localisation framework was designed to operate in variety of scenarios  such as the 3d positioning of objects  the simultaneous localisation of multiple stationary and mobile objects  localisation in outdoor settings  etc  the design principles in our framework aim towards practicality  relevance  and generality  8 conclusions and future work we proposed an accurate  scalable  reliable  streamlined rfid-based approach for localising objects  we have outlined several localisation challenges and developed practical techniques to mitigate them  we deployed uniformly sensitive four-way multi-tags in order to improve the object localisation accuracy and speed  furthermore  we analysed the impact of the reference tag density on the localisation accuracy  and compared the proposed localisation approach to existing methods  while these experiments were performed in an indoor setting  the proposed localisation approach is general enough to be widely applicable to other scenarios  e.g  3d regions  outdoor environments  multiple stationary  mobile object localisation  etc   future research can also strive for further improvements in the overall localisation speed  especially for moving objects  acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers
