interdisciplinary research for the period 2011-2014  and `` semantic location-based services for indoor environments ''  phc pavle savic 2012-2013   58 d.h stojanovi  n.m stojanovi sense and determine in real-time the location of mobile users  3   in open space  outdoors   mobile devices/users are most commonly and accurately positioned by gps technology and satellite-based infrastructure that provide location as a point in a geographic reference system  the current satellite positioning systems are  navstar global positioning system1  glonass2 and galileo3  which is expected to be fully operational in 2020 the main disadvantage of gps-based positioning is its dependency on a direct line-of-sight with the satellites and thus unavailability in indoor spaces  as well as in natural/urban canyons  also  the accuracy of positioning methods based on cellular networks  e.g  cell-id or toa time of arrival  is not sufficient for use indoors  nevertheless  people spend most of their time indoors  80-90 %   in offices  shopping malls  hospitals  metros  museums  etc  hence the possibility to determine locations and trajectories of people and objects inside buildings and other closed structures becomes increasingly important  for advanced indoor lbss supporting museum/fair guides  fire rescues  emergency management  or simply ordinary businesses  quality and effectiveness of services demand knowing immediately where people and resources are inside buildings and other complexes and how to navigate to certain locations  4   it is of great importance to provide seamless integration and handover of different localization technologies while users move from open space to various closed environments and vice-versa  and efficient adaptation of indoor lbss to changing environments  contexts and situations  with advances in sensor technologies and wireless communications  various indoor localization methods and systems have been developed over the past years  in indoor environments  positioning is mainly achieved through the use of radio technologies  such as wireless local area networks  wlan  wi-fi   bluetooth  zigbee  ultra-wideband  uwb   and radio-frequency identification  rfid   or infrared  ir  and ultrasound technologies  5   6   in 2011  twenty-two international companies formed the in-location alliance  7  to standardize and commercialize the indoor localization technologies and systems  the alliance currently includes large multi-national companies such as nokia  samsung  qualcomm and sony  and more than a hundred other high tech companies  showing the importance of indoor lbs research and development domain  this paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art methods  technologies and systems for indoor localization and tracking and reviews of some advanced indoor lbs applications based on these methods and technologies  the paper is organized as follows  section 2 describes methods and algorithms for pervasive positioning  section 3 presents indoor localization systems and technologies  gives their comparative classification  and presents representative examples of indoor lbs applications  the prominent research directions are categorized and discussed in section 4 finally  section 5 gives a conclusion  2 methods and techniques for indoor localization the core of any localization method relies on the real-time measurement of one to several parameters  such as angles  distances  or distance differences  8   measurement parameters reflect the location of a target object relative to a single point or several fixed 1 http  //www.gps.gov/ http  //www.glonass-ianc.rsa.ru/en/ 3 http  //www.esa.int/esana/galileo.html 2 indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 59 points in the environment with the known locations  such parameters are measured using physical characteristics of electromagnetic radio and infrared signals  as well as ultrasound signals  such as their travel time  velocity or attenuation  after the determination of the required parameters  the target objects location can be calculated using the measurement results and the known locations of the fixed points  there are four principal techniques and methods for location calculation and estimation  the proximity technique  see fig  1a  derives the location of a target object with respect to its vicinity to the location of the known object  s   a target object receives the signal from a given node  so the location of the node or the symbolic cell identification defines the location of a target  the triangulation technique uses the triangle geometry to compute locations of a target object  it is applied via lateration  actually trilateration   see fig  1b   that uses distance measurements to points with the known locations  or via angulation  sometimes also referred as triangulation   see fig  1c   which measures angles relative to points with the known arrangement  since electromagnetic/ultrasound signals move with the known and nearly constant speed  the determination of the time difference between sending and receiving a signal enables computation of the spatial distance between a transmitter and a receiver  known distances from three or more transmitters provide accurate positioning of the target object  for the angulation technique  antennas with direction capabilities are used  given two or more directions from fixed locations to the same object  the location of the target object can be computed  scene analysis techniques involve examination and matching a video/image or electromagnetic characteristics viewed/sensed from a target object  the analysis of electromagnetic scene sensed by a target object defined by electromagnetic signals and their strengths from different transmitters  provides the determination of location using a pattern matching  radio map technique  using video cameras  a positioning system can detect significant patterns in a video data stream to determine the users location  if users wear badges with certain labels  they can be detected in video images and thus localized and tracked in indoor environment covered by a camera  at the other extreme are techniques involving the matching of perspective video images of the environment captured by a camera  worn by a person or mounted on a mobile robot platform  to 3d models stored in an image/video database of the mobile device  dead reckoning techniques provide estimation of the location of a target object based on the last known location  assuming that the direction of motion and either the velocity of the target object or the traveled distance are known  n a  b  c  fig  1 location sensing techniques a  proximity b  trilateration c  angulation 60 d.h stojanovi  n.m stojanovi indoor localization technologies  based on one or more positioning techniques and methods  possess different characteristics that determine their suitability for specific indoor lbs and context-aware applications  indoor localization and tracking technologies can be based on either an existing communication network  or a dedicated network/infrastructure that is solely used to receive/transmit positioning signals  mobile devices worn by a person or mounted on a robot can be active when transmitting a signal themselves  or passive when just receiving a signal  the location can be determined in the mobile device itself  in the wireless network  or within the dedicated positioning infrastructure  indoor localization systems differ in accuracy  precision  scope  the type of determined location  geometric or symbolic  and the cost  an estimated location is considered accurate if it corresponds  as much as possible  to the true location of the target object  precision refers to the repeatability of the measurement and indicates how sharply a location can be defined for the sequence of location determinations  the accuracy of a localization system could be defined by an uncertainty area  i.e  the location is actually defined as an ellipse  ellipsoid  around the determined location  an indoor localization system delivers the target objects location with regard to a spatial reference system or to a defined symbolic space  geometric location is determined in the defined geographic/geometric reference system  such as wgs-84 or a local coordinate system  and can be either absolute or relative to a reference point  the localization and tracking of moving indoor objects can be either in 2-d  3-d  if the object can be localized in the entire volume of 3-d space  or in 2.5-d  when the object location is tracked at discrete levels  e.g  floors  of the 3rd spatial dimension  for the purpose of indoor navigation and tracking the symbolic location is more appropriate  thus  indoor localization systems mainly determine symbolic locations in terms of cell identifiers  buildings  room numbers  objects in the room  etc  indoor localization systems differ also in scope of location determination  since the majority of localization methods depend on the propagation properties of electromagnetic signals their effectiveness and efficiency depend on the environment  while satellite-based  gps  and cellular network-based positioning systems are intended for outdoor space with the scope that may be the whole earth  a certain region or a metropolitan area  indoor localization systems are characterized by a much narrow scope  such as a university campus  a building or a room  there exist a variety of indoor localization technologies and solutions intended for indoor spaces that require some kind of infrastructure that is usually not available in open space  an indoor localization system determines also the cost needed for a system to be fully operative  such as the time and space for installation and maintenance of the required infrastructure  as well as the price of equipment that is required  for example  the need for specialized hardware and/or network installations  leads to higher deployment and maintenance costs and poor scalability  indoor localization methods and technologies can be classified according to the scope of infrastructure needed for localization  the type of such infrastructure if any and their suitability for indoor or limited outdoor spaces  also  according to the part of the system where the location is calculated/estimated  i.e  whether a mobile device locates itself or is tracked  indoor localization systems can be centralized or distributed  all mentioned characteristics significantly determine the usability of particular indoor localization technologies for specific indoor lbs applications  indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 61 thus  according to the wireless communication and sensing technologies employed  indoor localization technologies can be classified as  wireless communication-based localization technologies  wi-fi  bluetooth  uwb  zigbee  rfid  ir  ultrasound  etc   are based on wireless communication or standalone infrastructure  wlan and wpan  constrained to indoor and limited outdoor spaces  providing determination of location either at the mobile device or in the infrastructure  dead reckoning localization technologies use motion sensors  accelerometer  digital compass  gyroscope  etc   and odometers to determine location at the device without the need for infrastructure  with the scope limited by the accumulated error  video scene analysis represents localization technologies based on the processing of video signals to detect specific tags in the scene  barcodes  or match the scene with prerecorded images/video to determine the location at either the mobile device itself  or to track target objects moving in the scene  3 indoor localization and tracking technologies and systems over the last twenty years  many indoor localization technologies have been proposed  developed and experimentally evaluated by both academia and industry that provide appropriate location data to tracking and navigation capabilities of indoor location-based and context-aware services  but there is still a lack of wide acceptance and large scale deployments of indoor localization systems  the most popular indoor localization systems use wi-fi technology  because of wide availability of wi-fi network infrastructure  9   wi-fi positioning systems use a radio propagation model to determine the distance to the various access points and then triangulation techniques  toa  tdoa  to estimate location of a mobile device  multipath distortion and variability of wi-fi signal strength in time limit the accuracy of such techniques  most currently available wi-fi positioning solutions are based on the scene analysis technique  called the fingerprinting technique  the method uses the received signal strength indication  rssi  to measure the strength of signals received from the surrounding access points at discrete locations in space  such a radio map has to be built before the system is operational  the calculation of the location consists of measuring the rssi from several access points  ap  and then attempting to match these measurements with the rssi values of the previously calibrated location points stored in a radio map database  depending on the pre-built radio map and the density of calibration points  the accuracy of the fingerprinting technique is expected to be in the range of 1 to 10 m  6   9   the major limitation of the wi-fi based fingerprinting localization systems is the construction of the rssi radio map that needs to be generated in advance and updated after furniture reallocation  removal/reallocation of the existing access points and installation of new ones  or algorithmically adapted  as proposed in  10   the fundamental problem in wi-fi fingerprinting is that heterogeneous mobile devices measure radio signal strength differently  in that case  either a calibration for each new wireless device is needed or specialized methods  such as hyperbolic location fingerprinting  presented in  11   need to be implemented  62 d.h stojanovi  n.m stojanovi one of the first wi-fi localization systems was radar  12   recently many wi-fi based localization systems emerged  hensen at al  in  13  describe smartcampusaau as a platform that enables indoor positioning and navigation based on wi-fi fingerprinting technique and supports both device and infrastructure-based positioning  the localization platform is available on all major mobile platforms  android  iphone and windows phone   the work of laoudias et al  in  14  presents the localization approach based on signal strength differences  that is more robust to device variations and maintains the localization accuracy regardless of the number and type of contributing devices  besides research works  several commercial localization systems are also available on the market  such as ekahau real-time location system  15   skyhook wireless  16  and navizon indoor location solutions  17   on the other hand  uwb communication technology has emerged  providing better positioning accuracy than wi-fi  it is suitable for high-precision real-time positioning using toa  tdoa  aoa and fingerprinting  uwb signals are less sensitive to multipath distortion and environment than conventional rf-based positioning systems  so they can achieve higher accuracy  at bandwidths of at least 500mhz and high time resolution in the order of nanoseconds  it is possible to obtain accuracy of ranging and localization at cmlevel  18   a music-based method proposed in  19  can achieve high localization accuracy  in the order of 1 cm  by using spatially distributed antennas that transmit the same uwb impulse sequence used for self-localization of ir uwb nodes  20   however  the high cost of uwb equipment and infrastructure deployment results in its limited availability for positioning  21   to date  several uwb positioning systems have been implemented and deployed  such as the ubisense system  22  and pulson  23  system developed by time domain  bluetooth is a wireless technology that can be used for localization and tracking  mainly indoors  bluetooth positioning systems have similar working principles as the selflocalization schemes of sensor networks  the operation principle of both types of systems is based on obtaining the range information to anchor devices or access points and exploring unknown device locations using various algorithms  the majority of the available research and commercial systems are based on trilateration using the rssi for calculating distances between bluetooth devices  although several reported systems have explored proximity  cell-based approach  a comprehensive evaluation of all bluetooth signal parameters and their suitability for localization purposes is provided in  24   bluetooth localization methods are primarily based on rssi and link quality  lq  measurements  cell-based methods rely on the proximity  visibility  of bluetooth beacons for determining the location of a device and are gaining popularity with the implementation of bluetooth le  low energy  standard  the localization accuracy of the system is 1  5 m  < 0.3 m for bluetooth le  and depends on the positioning technique used and the characteristics  density  layout  etc   of the deployed infrastructure of bluetooth devices and beacons  6   25   current examples of bluetooth positioning systems are zonith indoor positioning system  26   topaz  27  and apple ibeacon  28   in general  rfid systems are designed so that the reader detects the vicinity of a tag and retrieves the data stored in that tag  therefore  the absolute location of the tag is not known but the rfid system is aware that a tag is placed at a certain range that depends on the type of the system used  either active or passive rfid  29   besides the proximity technique that provides symbolic location of the tag according to a reader location  there indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 63 are several methods for performing accurate positioning using active rfid technology  these methods employ techniques such as aoa  tdoa and rssi that achieves accuracy in the range of 1-5 m  or even bellow 1m  depending on the density of tag deployment and rfid reading ranges  30   the examples of location sensing systems using the rfid technology are spoton  31  and landmarc  32   the zigbee technology is an emerging wireless communication standard for pan/lan intended for applications which do not need significant data throughput  but require lowpower consumption  as such  zigbee is widely used in smart home environments  the localization is usually performed using proximity and toa methods based on distances from the surrounding zigbee nodes calculated using rssi  several recent research papers propose and evaluate localization algorithms and systems based on zigbee achieving the accuracy of 1-10 m  5   larranaga et al  in  33  present a flexible indoor localization system based on zigbee wireless sensor networks based on rssi level measurements  the localization system consists of two phases  calibration phase  which is performed whenever a blind zigbee node needs to be located and actual localization phase with accuracy 3m on average  hu et al  in  34  propose an algorithm based on signal preprocessing and calibration to correct multipath propagation and improve zigbee based indoor localization  bras et al  in  35  describe a zigbee location protocol  implemented by reducing end nodes communication intervals and developing a proper router and coordinator firmware  this protocol provides two localization methods based on proximity and multi-rssi reference nodes location that provides support for triangulation and fingerprinting  dedicated positioning methods  commonly based on infrared and ultrasound technologies  provide a high degree of accuracy  but require expensive equipment limited to a small scale that usually have high installation and maintenance costs  5   in infrared  ir  -based systems  each tracked person is wearing a small infrared device that emits a unique pulse signal representing its unique identifier  the signals are detected by at least one particular ir sensor in the vicinity  a location server estimates ir device location by aggregating data obtained from fixed ir sensors deployed within the indoor environment  the active badge system  36   as the first ir positioning system  works this way and provides symbolic location information at the room or smaller level depending on deployed ir sensor infrastructure  ultrasound-based systems use an ultrasound time-of-flight lateration technique to provide more accurate physical positioning than by using infrared signals and sensors  the existence of nlos  non line of sight  conditions and multipath propagation in indoor environments are the main problems in the development of reliable ultrasound-based indoor localization system  achieving accuracy in the range of 1 cm 1m  37   the prominent examples are active bat system and the cricket indoor location system  5   many existing indoor localization approaches reviewed so far require infrastructure  e.g  bluetooth beacons  to achieve reliable accuracy  there are also passive positioning systems that do not require specialized infrastructure  such systems sense naturally occurring signals or physical phenomena and are based on  for example  magnetic compasses sensing the earths magnetic field  inertial sensors measuring acceleration and the heading of an object in motion  and vision systems sensing a scene and its features or recognizing specific visual patterns  barcodes   in order to be functional they require indoor map information  dead reckoning is the process of estimating the current location of a 64 d.h stojanovi  n.m stojanovi moving device using the location calculated at some previous time instant  and the velocity  speed or heading estimate till the current time instant  the dead reckoning-based localization systems  also known as inertial navigation systems  ins   can be used for both indoor and outdoor positioning  in indoor environment such systems use accelerometers to obtain human velocity rate information through step detection and step length estimation  also  digital compass and gyroscope measurements are used for direction and angular rate information  all measured data is processed to continuously calculate the location  direction  bearing   and velocity of a moving object without the need for external references  but taking into account the known indoor map constraints  on the other hand  the velocity of indoor vehicles or robots is calculated by appropriate odometers  however  even very small errors in the rate information provided by inertial sensors cause an unbounded growth in the error of the integrated measurements  usually referred as the drift error  dead reckoning based systems have been implemented in various indoor tracking domains  such as for pedestrian navigation  38  and mobile robot localization  39   40   hardegger et al  in  41  present smart actionslam  an android smartphone application that performs location tracking in home and office environments that uses the integrated motion sensors of the smartphone and an optional foot-mounted inertial measurement unit to perform personal localization and tracking  a mobile robot localization system that combines ins and odometry  and use kalman filters to estimate the orientation and velocity of mobile robots to calculate their more accurate positions  is presented in  39   localization systems that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure  or with which such an infrastructure could be deployed fast by e.g  ultrasound bacons  are particularly suitable for use by emergency responders such as firefighters  the conditions they work in are significantly more demanding  caused by darkness  smoke  fire  power outages  etc  so special efforts have been put to the research and development of appropriate localization and navigation systems based on dead reckoning  but also ultrasound and rfid  42   visual positioning systems use low cost 2d tags  e.g  barcodes  with the encoded information that can be recorded and processed by a mobile device with a built-in camera  as in the system proposed in  43   the symbolic location of a device is estimated by finding the tags identifier and associated location in a deployment database  or by decoding the location information embedded in the tag itself  44   positioning systems based on video scene analysis are based on computer vision technology to recognize tracked objects in video data  easy living by microsoft research provides one example of this approach  45  where a video surveillance system tracks moving objects recognized in the video scenes  also  the mobile device can use video scene analysis to estimate its location by comparing a snapshot of a scene generated by itself with a number of preobserved simplified images of the scene taken from different positions and perspectives  an improved performance and sub-meter  1 cm 1 m  accuracy of camera-based localization systems has promoted them as promising positioning solutions for applications in industry  as well as robot and pedestrian localization and navigation  46   murillo et al  in  47  present a wearable omnidirectional vision system and a novel twophase localization approach running on it for personal localization and guidance  it is based on real time visual odometry slam  simultaneous localization and mapping  method adapted to catadioptric images augmented with topological-semantic information  the important characteristics of indoor localization systems and related technologies are reviewed in table 1 indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 65 indoor lbss deliver local spatially-referenced information and spatialprocessing power to mobile users in accordance with their past  current and predicted location  or to the locations of the moving/stationary objects of their interest  depending on services requirements and the context of their usage  different indoor localization technologies and systems are used at the heart of such services  there are a lot of classifications and taxonomies of location-based services presented in the literature so far  1   48   while new services continue to emerge  this is an attempt to make a classification of indoor lbss  the localization technologies and systems they are based

junaio http  //www.junaio.com/ indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 67 5 research challenges localization technologies and location data collection systems provide many resources for the development of mobile and pervasive computing and applications  still  a lot of open issues and future research directions should be explored for the development of the next generation of location-based applications and services  5.1 seamless integration of localization methods and systems when considering the accuracy  availability and scope of a localization system while reducing its power consumption and cost  the integration of several localization technologies and systems is an option that might be relevant in many contexts  the goal of such integration is to improve the accuracy  availability and scale of single indoor localization systems while reducing cost  moreover  the integration should also provide seamless handover of integrated localization systems that selects the most suitable positioning method with appropriate accuracy  granularity and resource consumption according to the users context and situation and application requirements  khider et al  in  49  present the indoor localization system based on particle filter approach and sensor fusion that combines gnss  foot mounted inertial sensors  electronic compasses  baroaltimeters  indoor maps and active rfid tags to improve the accuracy and availability of the determined location  other examples of integrated indoor localization systems are the integration of gps and wi-fi based positioning  50   bluetooth-based positioning and ir-based positioning technique in topaz system  27  and a combination of ir and rfid localization to achieve higher accuracy in healthcare in versus rtls  51   5.2 handling massive location data sets with the rapid advances in mobile positioning technologies  a huge volume of location data is acquired wirelessly transmitted in the form of continuous data streams that need to be processed both off-line and online  so called big mobility data  such data with high arrival rate must be continuously monitored  processed and analyzed at the server side  continuous location data streams define trajectories of moving objects that provide unprecedented information to understand their mobility and behavior  52   within this research direction  methods and algorithms of mobility data stream management are investigated  as well as application of high-performance and data-intensive computing techniques and systems for handling massive trajectory data collections  both on-line and offline  such as cloud computing techniques  mapreduce   gpgpu  opencl  cuda  and cluster/grid  mpi   53   5.3 participatory location-based sensing with the proliferation of mobile phones with increasing sensing capabilities in everyday use  an important source of sensor data has become the users with their mobile devices  54   thanks to an increasing number of built-in sensors  ambient light  orientation  accelerometer  sound  camera  velocity  gps  but also user-generated content  video  photo  sound  text  etc    each mobile device can continuously capture  process  analyze and transmit spatially and temporally referenced data describing the context and the situation of the user  55   we need efficient methods  techniques  algorithms and 68 d.h stojanovi  n.m stojanovi systems that provide collection  monitoring  processing and analyzing of large volumes of moving sensor data that define the context and situation in an indoor environment relevant to a particular application domain  56   5.4 semantic location and trajectory data once the location of an indoor moving object is known  in either geometric or symbolic form  many other pieces of information can be inferred to enrich such location information  the research aims to develop methods and software tools to provide collection  processing and analysis of indoor location and trajectory semantics  semantic locations and trajectories enable development of advanced indoor lbss which can provide more intelligent  proactive and valuable services to users navigating in indoor  but also in outdoor environments  57   processing  analysis and mining of semantic indoor locations/trajectories provide insights in semantics of movement and recognition of user activities  behavior and prediction of a future movement  52   5.5 privacy in indoor location-based services although indoor location determination provides many valuable location-based applications and services to mobile users  revealing peoples locations to potentially untrusted service providers poses significant privacy concerns  there is a trade-off between the quality of services offered by an indoor lbs provider and the privacy of a users location  the research in this direction focuses on the protection of sensitive locations against lbs providers and untrusted members of collaborative geo-social networks  58   as such  it is highly related to all other research directions  releasing locations and trajectories to the public or a third party could pose serious privacy concerns  so privacy protection in a lbs and location/trajectory data collection has increasingly drawn attention from the research community and industry  59   6 conclusions this paper gives an overview of the methods  technologies and systems involved in the development of indoor location-based services for mobile users and moving objects navigated and tracked in the indoor environment  as no localization system is equally accessible and available everywhere  compromises between accuracy  scope  latency  privacy and costs may result in a system that seamlessly integrate two or more localization technologies and systems with regard to the corresponding application domain  for example  depending on the application requirements  the indoor lbs can employ wi-fi fingerprinting  bluetooth beacons  and/or dead reckoning technologies to achieve medium/low accuracy  high availability and coverage  as well as minimal costs for indoor installations  if the indoor lbs requires higher accuracy within small coverage  there is a need for extensive node  rfid  infrared  ultrasound  uwb  optical tags  etc   deployment and maintenance of a costly infrastructure  thus  depending on indoor lbs application requirements the appropriate trade-off between indoor localization characteristics should be made and integration of localization technologies and systems should be developed  research challenges in pervasive localization and tracking cover not only data collection methods which are reaching a relatively mature level  but also semantic and indoor localization and tracking  methods  technologies and research challenges 69 technical research avenues where the objective will be to make the best possible use of the data  this is why location-based and context-aware services and systems are the object of several exciting research efforts  from semantic to participatory sensing and privacy  and where several international projects are performed  such as the eu projects move4  knowledge discovery from moving objects  and modap 5  mobility  data mining  and privacy   60   no doubts that other research projects will soon emerge at the international level as opportunities cover many different location-based application domains that can be successfully applied to indoor and outdoor environments  references  1  s a ahson and m ilyas  eds  location-based services handbook
