mapping dominik joho christian plagemann 1.5 abstract in recent years  there has been an increasing interest within the robotics community in investigating whether radio frequency identification  rfid  technology can be utilized to solve localization and mapping problems in the context of mobile robots  we present a novel sensor model which can be utilized for localizing rfid tags and for tracking a mobile agent moving through an rfid-equipped environment  the proposed probabilistic sensor model characterizes the received signal strength indication  rssi  information as well as the tag detection events to achieve a higher modeling accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models which deal with one of these aspects only  we furthermore propose a method that is able to bootstrap such a sensor model in a fully unsupervised fashion  real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach also in comparison to existing techniques  9 8.5 8 7.5 7 6.5 6 5.5 5 4.5 1 0.5 0 -0.5

identification  rfid  technology has become popular in areas such as supply chain management and inventory control  primarily because information can be attached to real-world products cheaply and can be retrieved without requiring physical contact  recently  also robotics researchers have started to explore potential applications of the technology  focusing on the tasks of localization  mapping  and activity recognition  an rfid system consists of one or several rfid antennas and tags distributed in the environment  the antenna sends out electromagnetic waves and the passive rfid tags  consisting of a chip and a small antenna  use either load modulation or backscattering to send back their unique id to the receiver  ultra-high frequency  uhf  systems  one of which is also used in this work  has a reading range of up to a few meters  according to scenarios envisioned for the near future  virtually every retail product could be equipped with an rfid tag  in addition to the semantic information about a given environment or situation  1    2   such a setup also provides a rich source of spatial information  which can be utilized  a  to infer the location of the tags within the environment   b  to localize the sensor relative to them  or  c  to solve both tasks jointly  a major precondition for solving all these tasks is the availability of an accurate sensor model p  z | x  that characterizes the relationship between locations x and measurements z the contribution of this paper is two-fold  first  we present a novel sensor model that utilizes the received signal strength indication  rssi  as well as tag detection events to achieve superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models that cover one of the the authors are with the university of freiburg

shopping cart equipped with two rfid antennas  as a second contribution  we describe how our sensor model can be learned in an fully unsupervised fashion  we also compare our model with a sensor model that has been shown to be effective for wifi localization and we point out how this model can be further improved in the context of rfid localization and present experimental results  real-world experiments in an office environment and a supermarket demonstrate that our system is able to robustly estimate the position of the tags and to track a shopping cart moving through an rfid-equipped supermarket  the paper is organized as follows  after discussing related work in the field of rfid localization as well as in the related field of wifi localization  sec  iii then introduces the proposed sensor model  in section iv we explain how to learn the model in an unsupervised fashion and sec  v and vi contain a description about how this sensor model is utilized for localizing rfid tags and for tracking a shopping cart  finally  sec  vii presents real-world experiments that were performed in an office environment and a supermarket  3160 0.25 ii  r elated w ork 2 there is a variety of approaches to rfid-based localization  which can be characterized by the type of sensor information used as well as by the general approach to modeling this information  some of the earlier systems only provided information about the id of the detected tag while later systems also provide information about the received signal strength  hence  some localization techniques utilize sensor models that are based only on tag detection events  3    4    5    6    7   for some rfid readers that do not provide rssi  signal strength  directly  this information can be emulated by means of different attenuation levels or power levels of the antenna  8    9    10   sensor models for localizing tags are usually designed to be sensor centric  3    6    7    9   a different design  that can be used for localizing a mobile agent  is to lay out the sensor model relative to the environment  5    11    12    13   hahnel et al   3  utilized a piecewise constant tag detection sensor model to first localize the tags and then use the tag map to localize a mobile antenna  schneegans et al   5  compared histograms of tag detections with previously recorded histograms at different locations  kleiner et al   4  used a combination of pedestrian odometry and tag detections to perform graph-based rfid slam in a large outdoor environment  kanda et al   10  deployed rfid readers in a science museum and tracked people with attached rfid tags  vorst et al   14  showed how to learn a tag detection sensor model in a semi-autonomous fashion  some approaches in the context of wifi localization model the expected signal strength at different locations by using a discrete grid  11   or gaussian process regression  12    13   several approaches have addressed exclusively the tag localization problem  ni et al   8  compared the  emulated  signal strengths of tags at unknown locations with signal strengths received from reference tags at known locations  alippi et al   9  used several rotating antennas  ehrenberg et al   6  used an hf rfid system to localize books on a shelf  liu et al   7  used a tag detection model that is able to estimate the 3d position of the tag  in contrast to the above-mentioned approaches  we model both phenomenatag detection events as well as signal strength  the increased accuracy of the model allows us to address  a  localization of a mobile sensor relative to given tag locations and  b  mapping of tag locations when these are unknown  furthermore  we show how to simultaneously learn the sensor model and estimate the position of the rfid tags in an unsupervised fashion  we present realworld experiments in an office environment as well as in a supermarket environment and compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods  iii  t he s ensor m odel the techniques for localizing rfid tags as well as for tracking a mobile antenna both rely on a sensor model p  z | x  g  which specifies the likelihood of obtaining a measurement z given the pose x =  x  y   of the antenna and the location g =  xg  yg  of the detected tag with unique 0.25 2 0.2 1 0.2 1 0.15 0 0.15 0 0.1 -1 0.1 -1 0.05 -2 0.05 -2 0 -2 -1 0 1 2  a  rssi=log  2000  3 0 -2 -1

 rssi   we plot  a  rssi=log  2000  and  b  rssi=log  500   the antenna is located at  0  0  and oriented towards the positive x-axis  id g in our case  an observation z =  g  s  carries two pieces of information  namely that we have detected the tag g in the first place  and secondly that we received its signal with a signal strength s indeed  the event of detecting a tag is informative in itself  and this fact forms the basis for many of the previously proposed probabilistic sensor models for tag localization  3    6    7    14   note also that the other class of existing sensor models  which consider signal strength only  implicitly condition on the tag detection event since a signal strength measurement can be obtained in this way only  we make the distinction between both sources of information explicit by denoting with d the binary variable that encodes the detection of a certain tag  hence  the sensor model can be formalized as p  z | x  g  = p  s  d | x  g  = p  s | d  x  g  p  d | x  g    1  in the most general form  these two conditional distributions are intractable to learn in practice since  for example  p  d | x  g  specifies a tag detection probability for every possible combination of antenna pose x and tag location g  therefore  we make the common assumption that only the relative location  x  g  of a tag with respect to the antenna is relevant  see  3    6    7    14    this assumption certainly is a strong one  since the propagation of an rfid signal is also influenced by location-dependent factors  such as the materials the tags are attached to  the orientation of the tags relative to the antenna  or obstacles that reflect or absorb electro magnetic waves  the gain in efficiency  however  is large in comparison to other simplifications that could be made  as we will show in the experimental evaluation  the accuracy of a location-dependent sensor model for rfid tags is slightly higher than of our model  but that gain comes at a high computational cost already for small environments  committing ourselves to sensor-centric sensor modeling  which considers relative tag positions only as outlined above  we get p  z | x  g  = p  s | d   x  g   p  d |  x  g     2  in words  this models the likelihood of an observation as the likelihood of receiving signal strength s at position  x  g  relative to the antenna multiplied by the probability of detecting a tag at this relative position  3161 about the average received logarithmic signal strength x  y and the empirical variance x  y for each grid cell  under the assumption that the logarithmic signal strengths within each grid cell are normally distributed  we can estimate the likelihood of an observation z =  g  s  at the antenna relative position  xt  g  =  x  y  as p  z | x  g  = p  s | d   x  g   p  d |  x  g    3     log  s  x  y  2 1 exp px  y  2 2x  y x  y 2 b bootstrapping the sensor model fig  3  ground truth tag locations  black  and tag locations estimated  green / gray  with the initial sensor model  top   and with the learned models at bootstrapping iterations 2  middle  and 25  bottom   location-dependent sensor models  that characterize the distribution of signal strength relative to the environment rather than to the sensor  see  11    12    13    can be understood as a different approximation that stays more faithful to the true signal strength distribution  instead of conditioning the signal strength on the relative tag position  they learn a separate signal strength distribution pg  s | x  for each tag individually  which is conditioned only on the antenna location  the resulting signal strength maps implicitly contain all environment-specific factors  on the downside  they do not model the location of the tag explicitly and  thus  can not be used to estimate the location of the tags directly  iv  l earning the m odel from data we first describe how the components of  2  can be learned in a semi-autonomous way and then extend this procedure to an unsupervised bootstrapping method  a semi-autonomous learning vorst et al   14  proposed a method for learning a tag detection sensor model in a semi-autonomous fashion  which we will adopt and extend towards also learning the signal strength distribution  building on this  we show how to learn both models in an fully autonomous way  the semiautonomous way of learning a tag detection model is to assume a list of tag positions given as well as the trajectory of a mobile antenna moving through the environment  at every tag detection event  we transform the positions of tags into the antennas local coordinate system and register the tag detection at the tags relative position as a positive event while registering the non-detected tags as negative events  we then discretize the space relative to the antenna according to a two-dimensional grid and count for every grid cell  x  y  the positive events n+ x  y and the negative events nx  y  given these counts  the maximum likelihood estimator of  + the tag detection probability is px  y = n+ x  y / nx  y + nx  y  likewise  we maintain a second grid that contains statistics so far  learning the sensor models required knowledge about the true tag positions  which might be tedious or impossible to acquire  we can sidestep this  by bootstrapping the sensor models  we start with a basic  yet plausible tag detection model similar to the one proposed by hahnel et al   3  and iterate the following steps  1  use the current model to estimate the tag locations  as described in the next section  and 2  learn a new sensor model based on the estimated tag locations  as described above   in the experimental section  we present results that indicate that alternating tag location estimation and sensor model learning converges in terms of tag location error and the similarity of the bootstrapped sensor model to a model learned in a semi-autonomous way  fig  1 shows an example for a sensor model learned this way in an office environment  fig  2 visualizes two instances of the corresponding inverse sensor model  that is  the likelihood of relative poses given a certain level of received signal strength  this model has been calculated analytically from the three components of the sensor model depicted in fig  1 the improvement of the estimated tag locations during the bootstrapping procedure is illustrated in fig  3 based on this bootstrapping procedure  we can learn both the sensor model and the tag locations in a fully unsupervised fashion  this greatly simplifies sensor modeling in practice  compared to the manual acquisition of calibration data  in contrast to the semi-autonomous method  it does not require knowledge about the true tag positions  v m apping tags from k nown s ensor p oses for localizing rfid tags  we move a mobile antenna through the environment and integrate the measurements iteratively so that the estimates of tag locations improve gradually over time  we assume that the antenna is localized  e.g  applying laser-based fastslam  15   so that we have accurate estimates of the positions at which observations have been made  formally  we are given a sequence of tag readings z1  t =   gi  si   ti=1 denoting the unique id g of the detected tag and the received signal strength s  as well as a sequence of antenna poses x1  t =   xi  yi  i   ti=1  denoting the antennas position and orientation at which these observations have been made  we are interested in the posterior p  g | x1  t  z1  t  of the tag location g =  xg  yg  given the 3162  a  initial filter state   b  after second filter update   c  after 5th filter update   d  after 30th filter update  fig  4  localizing rfid tags in an office corridor  the green circle indicates the estimated tag location and the black circle the pose of the shopping cart  information up to time t using bayes rule and assuming independence between measurements  we get the recursive update formula p  g |x1  t  z1  t  = p  zt |  xt  g   p  g | x1  t1  z1  t1    4  where p  zt |  xt  g   is the sensor model described in the previous section and is a normalization factor  see also  3    to estimate this posterior sequentially as new data arrives  we apply a particle filter for each tag and use its unique id for data association  each filter is initialized with a uniform particle distribution bounded by the maximum reading range of the antenna and centered around the antennas position during the first encounter of the tag  visualized in fig  4  a    we resample whenever the so-called number of effective p 2 1 falls below a threshold  particles neff = w i i which we set to half the number of particles of the filter  here  wi denotes the weight of particle i following liu and west  16   we disturb the individual particle locations by resampling them from a normal distribution with mean ap  i  +  1 a  p and variance h2 v here  p and v are the mean and covariance matrix of the particle set and a = 31 2 and h2 = 1 a2 only depend on a discount factor  which we set to 0.95 this procedure causes the particlebased estimates of the tag locations to converge to the true locations even for crudely initialized estimates within a few filter iterations  as can be seen in fig  4 that consists of the current pose x =  x  y   of the cart  its velocity xparameterized by the translational velocity x in direction of the cart  a lateral drift velocity y  and a rotational velocity and a discrete motion state m  which can be one of the following seven states  standing  moving forwards  backwards   turning left forwards  backwards   or turning right forwards  backwards    i  the transition from one particle state pt to the state  i  pt+1 at the next point in time is modeled as follows  first  we sample a new motion state mt+1 according to a state transition probability p  mt+1 | mt   if the motion state changed  we sample new velocities xt+1 from three motion state specific normal distributions n  m  x  m  x   n  m  y  m  y   n  m   m   that capture the velocity distributions of the particular state  if the sampled motion state is the same as in the time step before  we do not sample new velocities  but keep the velocities of the previous point in time  once the new velocities are determined  we deterministically compute the new pose of a particle based on the velocities and the time passed during one filter update step  as during tag localization  we resample whenever the number of effective particles is less than half of the particle set size  to account for physical constraints imposed by walls and other obstacles  we set the weight of a particle close to zero  whenever it enters an occupancy grid cell that is likely to be occupied  the transition probabilities and the velocity distributions of the motion model were learned from recorded trajectories with hand-labeled motion states  vi  l ocalizing a m obile agent given that we know the locations of the rfid tags  we can use the very same sensor model to track a mobile agent equipped with an rfid antenna  we apply monte carlo localization  mcl   17   which utilizes a particle filter to maintain the posterior over the agents location bel  xt+1  = p  zt+1 |  xt+1  g   z p  xt+1 | xt  bel  xt  dxt   5  while the sensor model p  z |  x  g   remains the same  the crucial part here is the motion model p  xt+1 | xt   from which we sample the next particle distribution  as we are tracking a shopping cart  which does not provide odometry information  we used a velocity based motion model that tries to capture the typical motion patterns of people pushing the cart  for this  each particle p  i  is constrained in a sevendimensional space p  i  =  x  x  m  =  x  y   x  y   m    6  vii  e xperimental e valuation to evaluate our approach  we equipped a shopping cart with a sick rfi 641 uhf rfid reader with two antennas mounted perpendicular to each side of the cart  see fig  6   the reader also reports which antenna detected the tag  and we know their positions relative to the center of the cart  as the antennas are identical in construction we assume the same sensor model for both  the reader is configured to run in continuous mode  reporting a tag as soon as it is detected  the typical tag detection rate of the system is about 10 hz  we used passive uhf tags  dogbone by upm raflatac   in order to acquire a ground truth trajectory and an occupancy grid of the environment we additionally equipped the cart with a sick lms 291 laser scanner and processed the data with the gmapping algorithm  15   which is an efficient laser-based realization of the fastslam approach  in the remainder of this section we present experimental

and  c  show that the bootstrapping procedure also converges in terms of sensor model similarity to a semi-autonomously learned model  a localizing the rfid tags we distributed 28 rfid tags in an office corridor as depicted by the black circles in fig  3 neighboring tags had an average distance of about two meters  we knew the true locations of the tags and therefore could evaluate the accuracy of tag localization quantitatively  we bootstrapped the sensor model by moving the shopping cart up and down the corridor several timesperforming 360 turns at several locations  this took about 4 minutes and resulted in roughly 4100 tag detections  fig  5  a  shows the evolution of the average error of the estimated tag locations after each iteration of the bootstrapping process  as can be seen  the error converges to a final value of about 29 cm  we also give the estimation results for  a  the signal strength-based model alone and  b  the tag detection-based model alone evaluated on the same trajectory  the proposed combined sensor model is significantly better than either the signal strength-based model or the tag detection-based one alone  if we learn the sensor model semi-autonomously based on the true tag locations  we achieve a localization accuracy of about 27 cm  this indicates  that the bootstrapping process yields a sensor model that is comparable to a semiautonomously learned sensor model  this was also confirmed by visually comparing the individual components of the two models  to confirm this finding quantitatively  we calculated the average symmetric kullback-leibler divergence between all grid cells of the two models after each bootstrapping iteration  the results illustrated in figs  5  b  and  c  show that the bootstrapping process also converges in terms of model similarity to a semi-autonomously learned model  b localizing a mobile agent we distributed about 350 tags along the shelves in a supermarket at an average distance of approximately one meter  then we bootstrapped the sensor models and the tag fig  6  we equipped a shopping cart with an rfid reader and a laser range scanner and deployed about 350 passive uhf tags in a supermarket  fig  7  comparison of the estimated trajectory  black  and the ground truth trajectory  red / gray  on one of the supermarket log files  positions by using data from six log files  which we collected by moving the shopping cart through the environment  the log files contained 34 200 tag detections and lasted about 74 minutes in total  we used the agent localization technique described above and defined as the localization result the trajectory of the most likely particle  an example of an estimated trajectory and its corresponding ground truth trajectory is depicted in fig  7 as well as in the accompanying video  to evaluate the accuracy of the localization technique quantitatively  we localized the agent on seven different log files which lasted 24 minutes in total and contained 13 400 tag detections  we repeatedly localized the cart for each log file ten times and averaged the measured error values  the error was quantified in terms of the average position error and the average orientation error  results are given in fig  8 using only the tag detection model can be considered equivalent to the approach by vorst et al   14   for further comparison  we implemented a model similar to the one presented by ferris et al   13   which used gaussian process regression  18  to model the signal strength distributions of wlan access points in 2d space  we used gaussian process regression for modeling the log-signal strength of the rfid tags in the supermarket  we observed that the estimation of the carts orientation can be significantly improved  fig  8  b    if the antennas orientation is taken into account  and hence the signal strength is mapped in pose space rather than in 2d  the proposed combined sensor model outperforms both of its componentsthe tag detection model and the signal strength modeland performs comparable to the signal strength map  both methods can be executed online for 2 500 particles  but the proposed model needs only 2.6 minutes on average to process all log files  while the signal 3164 1.4 0.65 0.65 0.6 0.6 0.55 0.5 1.2 1 0.45 0.8 0.4 0.6 0.35 0.4 0.2 250 500 0.3 1000 number of particles 2500  a  average

alone  for comparison  we show the results of a signal strength map  similar to the model by ferris et al   13   mapping the signal strength either in pose space  pose  or in 2d  point   strength map  which uses gaussian process regression instead of a grid  requires 13.4 minutes  as can be seen in fig  8  c   in both taskslocalization and mappingthe signal strength model alone was consistently less accurate than the tag detection model  this is an unexpected finding  since the received signal strength should intuitively be more informative than a simple detection event  close inspection of the recorded data reveals  however  that the relationship between signal-strength and sensor location is more noisy than it is the case for tag detections  thus  the particle filter as a sophisticated way of integrating information over time  is able to recover the  real-valued  pose information accurately from the stream of  binary  tag detection events  viii  f uture w ork there are several directions for future work  our results showed that considering signal strength information along with tag detection events lead to an improved sensor centric model  therefore  it would be interesting to see if the accuracy of signal strength maps could be improved in just the same way by combining them with tag detection maps  another direction would be to extend the model to a 3d sensor model  moreover  the assumption made that the tag map remains static could be alleviateda technique for mapping nomadic tags  static tags which change locations from time to time  was presented in  7   ix  c onclusions in this paper  we presented a novel combined sensor model that utilizes both  a  the received signal strength and  b  tag detections of rfid systems for robot localization and mapping of tags  we also presented a technique to learn such a model in an unsupervised way  this greatly simplifies the task of sensor modeling in practice compared to the manual acquisition of calibration data  for comparison  we implemented a sensor model that has been shown to be effective for wifi localization  we furthermore described how this model can be improved in the context of rfid localization  as our experiments in several real-world settings showed  our approach achieves the computational efficiency of existing sensor-centric models and an accuracy of a state-of-the-art approach that learns a location-dependent model for each tag  acknowledgement this work has been supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft  dfg  under contract number sfb/tr 8 spatial cognition  r6
