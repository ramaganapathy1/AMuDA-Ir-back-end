also operate in a distributed manner without a central ap  this mode is often known as the ad hoc mode of operation  simplified architectural representation of 802.11 networks has been shown in figure 1  1   note that in order to provide positioning services  only the infrastructure-based 802.11 networks are used  802.11 networks are inherently designed for indoor low-mobility network applications  for example  they may be deployed in an office building to connect the employees to a network without running cables and wires  while these indoor aps are primarily meant to provide communication services for the end users  their use in more innovative applications is also being examined by the research community  more recently  the research interest in using wi-fi networks for positioning purposes has risen significantly  the global positioning system  gps  is generally used for positioning purposes but its service deteriorates when it is employed in the indoor environments  this fact has fuelled the research activities in enabling wi-fi positioning system  wps   since wi-fi networks are not primarily meant to support localization services  employing wps poses significant research challenges that are currently being pursued  wps uses the signal strengths of periodic beacon signals transmitted by the aps to locate a mobile node  these beacon signals are broadcast every 100msec to advertise the presence of aps in a certain area  the mobile nodes register their willingness to connect to an ap by responding to these beacon signals  wps employs two methods of using the received signal strength  rss  information from the beacon signals  this paper overviews both methods  namely trilateration and fingerprinting  abstract the global positioning system  gps  is widely used for providing positioning services across the world  while it performs well in the outdoor conditions where receivers maintain los with the gps satellites  the performance of gps quickly deteriorates in the indoor environments  due to this reason  the research interest in exploring 802.11 wi-fi networks for providing positioning services has risen significantly  wi-fi positioning system  wps  uses trilateration and fingerprinting methods to determine a receivers position typically in the indoor environment  in this paper  we discuss these methods in the light of experimental observations  the discussion is aimed at highlighting a few open research issues pertinent to the effective use of wi-fi positioning system  keywords wi-fi positioning  trilateration  fingerprinting  probability distributions  i introduction the ieee 802.3 ethernet is concerned with protocols and standards that allow communication between the devices over a wired local area network  lan   lans use guided media such as cables and wires to connect the end users to the backhaul network  which is commonly the internet  the ieee 802.11 standard introduces the wireless version of lans  commonly known as wi-fi  or wireless lan   the freedom from wires and the ease of mobility are two important factors in the popularity and widespread use of the 802.11 wi-fi networks  802.11 networks have been massively deployed in universities  offices  homes  restaurants  airports  shopping malls  etc  ever since their introduction in 1999 a typical wi-fi network is composed of an access point  ap  connected to the backhaul network on one end  and connected wirelessly to the mobile nodes on the other end  these aps can be seen as small base stations that liaison communication activity

technique is the fluctuating nature of the signal strength  this ever changing nature makes it difficult to translate signal strength measures into distance  the problem gets more complicated in the indoor environments where the signal gets attenuated by various objects  2   intuitively  signal strength decreases as the distance between the mobile node and the ap is increased  however  this inverse relation is difficult to express mathematically  in fact  developing a mathematical model that relates distance with the signal strength is still an open area of research  another problem with in using trilateration is that the variation in the signal strength is also affected by the orientation of the mobile node  the following tests suggest that the trilateration method should also take into account the orientation of a mobile node for accurate positioning  a laptop  with intel centrino advanced-n 6230 wireless card on intel mobile express chipset running windows 7  measures the received signal strength from an ap in the indoor los conditions  readings are taken at 6 steps such that the horizontal distance between two consecutive steps is approximately 7ft  the first step is also 7ft away from the foot of the ap  at each step  5 readings each in 4 directions  north  south  east and west  are taken  the average of these 20 readings is recorded as the signal strength observed at that step  for the readings taken in the north direction  the antenna of the mobile node faces the ap directly  on the other hand  for the readings taken in the south direction  human body comes between the ap and the mobile node  figure 2 shows the signal strengths recorded in each of the four directions at all 6 steps  and their overall average  the differences in the curves reported in figure 2 show that orientation of the mobile node affects the received signal strength considerably  note that the signal strengths recorded at steps 2 and 3 for the east and south directions are quite different  this infers that  in trilateration method  information on signal strength alone is not enough to make reasonable predictions about the position of the mobile node  orientation of the mobile node also needs to be considered to improve the positioning accuracy  the orientation factor also needs to be accommodated into any mathematical model that sets out to translate rss into distance  as mentioned earlier  accurate models to translate signal strength measures into distance are still not available  because conversion of signal strength measures into distance is a complex task due to the unpredictable nature of the rss  3   the fingerprinting method is often preferred over trilateration in wps  figure 1   a  ad hoc mode where nodes do not use aps   b  infrastructure mode where mn1 and mn2 are communicating over the internet using ap1 and ap2  1   figure 2  signal strength variations with changing distance and orientation of the mobile node  this paper has been composed to provide an overview of the wi-fi positioning system  the rest of this paper is organized as follows  the next section discusses the trilateration and fingerprinting methods with the help of experiments  this paper is concluded in section iii while the acknowledgements and references are given at the end of this paper  ii  positioning methods based on a variety of experiments  this section discusses the trilateration and fingerprinting methods used in wps  a trilateration method the trilateration technique uses the signal strength measured from at least three aps to determine the 2d position of a mobile device  the distance of a mobile node from three aps can be used in the elementary distance www.ijrws.org 32 international journal of research in wireless systems  ijrws   volume 1  issue 1  november  2012  vehicular navigation  fingerprinting shall require extensive drive tests across the cities on a periodic basis  despite these limitations  fingerprinting technique has been used in various previous works and has shown reasonable accuracy  4   matching an observed value with a pre-recorded database can either be deterministic or probabilistic  in deterministic matching  one-point or multi-point matching  5  6  is used to compare the observed values with a precalculated map  in probabilistic matching  signal strength values are represented as a probability distribution  e.g  gaussian distribution   and the matching is done using histograms or kernel methods  7   as the name suggests  probabilistic fingerprinting calculates the probability of a user being at a certain location based on the online measurements and rss database  it follows that the rss database plays a vital role in finger-printing based positioning  the probabilistic fingerprinting method has been examined in literature for controlled  under laboratory settings with minimum perturbations  and uncontrolled environments  typical office setting  both  ideally  a database trained for an area should exhibit the same characteristics in both controlled and uncontrolled setups  in order to investigate the temporal variations of the database  we have conducted a simple fingerprinting experiment on wi-fi networks  while most relevant works focus on analyzing algorithms for data processing and matching  8   this analysis discusses the probability distribution of the database used in fingerprinting  the main motivation is to check the differences in the probability distributions corresponding to controlled and uncontrolled setups  rss samples from a particular ap are recorded at 6 different locations in the main hall of the mechanical engineering building at kaist as shown in figure 3 at every test point  5 samples are taken in each of the four directions as shown in the figure  in this way  20 samples are collected with 5-second sampling interval at each test point  as opposed to 12 samples used in  9    two such tests on two different days have been conducted to represent the controlled and uncontrolled environments  the first test  known as the controlled test  was conducted over the weekend when the hall remained mostly empty  little or no human motion was experienced and the surrounding environment remained static  the second test  known as the uncontrolled test  was conducted on a weekday  several people passed by the area during the test and the mobile node experienced large human motion  figure 3  test area for analyzing fingerprinting database  figure 4  cumulative distribution functions for controlled and uncontrolled tests  b fingerprinting method location fingerprinting  also referred to as the scene analysis method  identifies the user location by matching the rss observations made by the mobile node with a trained database  this method compares the online measurements made by the mobile device with those recorded in a database to locate the device  4   hence  the wi-fi fingerprinting method comprises of an online and an offline phase  in the offline phase  the rss fingerprints are taken at different target locations throughout the area of interest and recorded in a database  in the online phase  the mobile device first measures the prevailing rss value and then matches it with the database  the geographical location that corresponds to the observed signal strength is recognized as the user location  it is obvious that wi-fi fingerprinting requires extensive site surveys that are labor intensive  removal and/or addition of new aps in the area of interest would require modifications in the database  in high mobility applications  for example in www.ijrws.org 33 international journal of research in wireless systems  ijrws   volume 1  issue 1  november  2012  uncontrolled test  it can be seen that the data distribution does not comply fully with the normal distribution  particularly in the rss range -70 to -67dbm  this deviation may give rise to positioning inaccuracies if the dataset is assumed to follow normal distribution  in the light of this discussion  we conclude that different conditions in the controlled and uncontrolled setup may bring about changes in the probability distribution of the database  these changes should be taken into account while using the probabilistic fingerprinting method  iii  conclusion there has been increasing interest in exploring the use of wi-fi networks for positioning purposes  this interest has risen significantly because  i  gps services are suspended in the indoor non-los environments and  ii  a large number of wi-fi access points  aps  are already deployed in the indoor setups  this paper is concerned with providing an experimental overview of the positioning methods use in the wi-fi positioning systems  wps   based on a variety of experiments  the procedures involved in the trilateration and fingerprinting methods have been discussed  it has been discussed that the trilateration method attempts to translate the received signal strength into distance between an ap and mobile node  however  the variation in signal strength due to changing environment as well as the orientation of the mobile node makes it difficult to employ trilateriation for positioning  on the other hand  fingerprinting method uses a database of signal strength samples collected across the region of interest to determine a devices position  it has been shown that the probability distributions of the database generated for the same area under controlled and uncontrolled conditions may be different  therefore  all analyses and performance evaluation pertinent to fingerprinting must be done in real uncontrolled setup  figure 5  probability plots for controlled and uncontrolled tests  figure 6  pdf and normal fit of uncontrolled dataset  the cumulative distribution function and probability plot of the recorded samples for the two tests along with the corresponding normal fits have been shown in figure 4 and figure 5 respectively  a rough visual assessment of the figures reveals that the samples conform to the normal distribution  also note that very little variation exists in the probability distributions of the samples recorded for controlled and uncontrolled tests  to determine the goodness of fit  chi square test was performed at the two datasets  it was found that in case of the controlled test  the null hypothesis that the samples were drawn from a normal distribution can not be rejected  on the other hand  in case of uncontrolled test the null hypothesis can be rejected  while the fingerprinting database was found to follow normal distribution in both controlled and uncontrolled setups  datasets conformity to the normal distribution is better in the controlled environments  figure 6 shows the probability distribution of the samples collected during the www.ijrws.org acknowledgement this paper has been funded by the samsung academic research fund
