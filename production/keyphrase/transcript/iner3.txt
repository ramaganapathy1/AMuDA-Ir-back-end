Wireless indoor positioning has been extensively studied for the past 2 decades and continuously attracted
growing research efforts in mobile computing context. As the integration of multiple inertial sensors (e.g.,
accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to nowadays smartphones in recent years, human-centric
mobility sensing is emerging and coming into vogue. Mobility information, as a new dimension in addition
to wireless signals, can benefit localization in a number of ways, since location and mobility are by nature
related in the physical world. In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphonebased indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors
we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists
localization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location
context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement
errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences,
we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we
conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and opportunities in this new and largely open
area.

1. INTRODUCTION

Modern smartphones have been equipped with a number of sensors, which make smartphones not only a communication tool, but also a sensing device. After several years of
this trend since iPhone’s birth, in addition to point-to-point phone calls, smartphones
are rapidly becoming an important interface that bridges the physical and digital
worlds.

Taking the case of an iPhone, it includes various types of sensors (including microphone, camera, proximity sensor, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.),
through which sound, image, video, location, and mobility information can be measured by phones. Thus, human-centric environmental sensing is brought forward.
Based on smartphones, we are able to know and record user movements (standing,
sitting, walking, running) [Park et al. 2012; Brajdic and Harle 2013; Wu et al. 2013b],
user environments (indoor/outdoor, office/home, on board) [Rachuri et al. 2010; Zhou
et al. 2012b; Yang et al. 2014], and user activities (driving, cycling, sleeping, having a
meeting or class) [Yang et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2012a; You et al. 2013].
The richness of sensors reinvents the smartphone as a magic box, in which many
novel mobile applications are given birth and developed. One simple but interesting
application is to help users judge the taste of a watermelon without cutting it. The
way is that users first press a phone closely against a watermelon and then knock
the watermelon from outside. The application then provides a suggestion according
to the sound of knocking, which is automatically recorded by microphones. A more
complicated application is to monitor the quality of all-night sleeping. When a user
goes to bed, he puts a phone on the bed as well, with the built-in sensors detecting the
body and limb movements. The phone offers a sum-up report of sleeping based on some
professional medical knowledge when the user gets up in the morning. The inertial
sensors play a key role in this application.
In retrospect, before the prevalence of smartphones, whereas laptops, PDAs, and
ordinary phones are all truly mobile devices, they have seldom been involved in humancentric sensing for lack of sensors.
Although smartphone-based sensors can facilitate a wide range of services, this
article focuses on positioning; that is, how mobility (measured by inertial sensors)
increases localizability of nowadays indoor localization systems.
Accurate, reliable, and ubiquitous indoor localization systems are the key enabler for
a wide range of personal, commercial, medical, and public services and applications.
Different from outdoor positioning where GPS almost dominates the market, indoor
localization embraces a technology flourish. Many techniques and systems are designed
and come into service, providing various levels of accuracy, cost, and applicability. For
example, optical positioning mainly targets at submillimeter application domains, yet
involves privacy concerns and intensive computing complexity [Mautz and Tilch 2011].
Ultrasonic signals generally offer an accuracy of centimeters [Priyantha et al. 2000;
Ubisense 2013] at the cost of extra ultrasound infrastructure. With the astonishing
growth of wireless devices and networks, wireless indoor localization has attracted
extensive research efforts in the past 2 decades [Bahl and Padmanabhan 2000; Youssef
and Agrawala 2005; Ni et al. 2003; Azizyan et al. 2009; Sen et al. 2012; Lim et al. 2006;
Constandache et al. 2010b; Liu et al. 2012; Yoon et al. 2013; Sen et al. 2013; Liu et al.
2013].
The diversity of application requirements results in the concurrent progress of different wireless-based positioning techniques. Among all techniques, WiFi-based positioning is one of the most popular, mainly due to the worldwide availability of WiFi
technology. The rationale behind WiFi positioning is straightforward. A mobile device,
at somewhere covered by a WiFi signal, records the hearable WiFi Access Points (APs)
and their corresponding signal strength as the radio signal characteristics (a.k.a. signal
fingerprint) for this specific position. Such a fingerprint, as a location query, is further
sent to a location service provider who has a WiFi fingerprint database of a great
amount of fingerprints collected at every position within an area of interest. The location service provider then retrieves the database for the most similar fingerprint with
respect to the location query, and returns its corresponding recorded location as the
location estimation. The uniqueness of WiFi APs (in terms of the MAC addresses) and

the signal attenuation across space account for the principle of WiFi positioning. From
the systematic aspect, the process of localization is composed of two stages: training
and operating [Yang et al. 2012]. During the training phase, traditional methods involve a site survey process (a.k.a. calibration), in which professional engineers record
the signal characteristics (known as fingerprints) at every location of an interested
area. The collected fingerprints and their corresponding locations are then associated
with each other to build up a fingerprint database. When a new user tries to locate
himself during the operating phase, he queries his location by uploading his signal
fingerprint to the server. The server retrieves the database by comparing fingerprints,
and returns the location with the best matched fingerprint to the user.
WiFi positioning is booming recently. In late 2011, Google Map 6.0 announced new
services of indoor positioning and navigation [McClendon 2011]. Other followers include Microsoft’s Bing Maps, Baidu’s Interior Maps, Nokia’s Here (formerly Ovi Maps),
etc. In addition, Skyhook Wireless [Skyhook 2013] manages a global location database
with more than a billion WiFi access points and millions of venues and serves a variety
of customers from individual application developers to industry giants including Apple,
Google, and Sony.
Despite its success, WiFi positioning faces several challenges on its fast track of
development.
—Location error. The indoor attenuation of wireless signals is extraordinarily unpredictable because of complex environmental factors, leading to decreased performance
of widely used signal models. For instance, multipath fading brings about strenuous
fluctuation on signal amplitudes in small scale of only several centimeters [Sen et al.
2013; Wu et al. 2012]. Besides, environmental dynamics (such as human movements,
door opening and closing, and furniture rearrangement) can also change the signal
strength distribution across an area [Fet et al. 2013]. To make things worse, some
researchers observe experimentally that two far-away locations in an open indoor
space may have similar signal fingerprints, which, according to the scheme of WiFi
positioning, may induce incorrect location estimation [Liu et al. 2012; Sun et al.
2013a].
—Deployment cost. The procedure of site survey is time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and vulnerable to environmental dynamics [Chintalapudi et al. 2010; Yang et al.
2012]. However, it is inevitable for fingerprinting-based approaches, since the fingerprint database relies on locationally labeled fingerprints from on-site records
[Chintalapudi et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012]. Even the indoor mapping services of Google Map 6.0 was available only at selected airports and shopping
malls in several districts (e.g., the US and Japan) at its release [McClendon 2011]. Its
applicability to broader areas is strangled by the limited quantity and granularity
of fingerprint data of building interiors. The worldwide usage of indoor positioning
calls for low deployment cost.
—Absence of location context. Locations, in indoor environments, are strongly related
to human activities, which motivates people to discover the semantic context of
locations. Location context refers to the name, usage, function, and activity of a
specific location that users can understand and feel intuitively [Schmidt et al. 1999;
Kim et al. 2009; Azizyan et al. 2009; Ye et al. 2011]. In many cases, the context of a
location is equally valuable to or even more valuable than location itself. For example,
comparing with the absolute X-Y coordinates, it is more meaningful for users inside
buildings to know room numbers or room usages such as office rooms, meeting rooms,
or corridors. Furthermore, a route in a floor plan toward the nearest printer is more
convenient than the printer’s location coordinates. Nevertheless, WiFi positioning is
powerless on distinguishing rooms, identifying room usage, generating indoor maps,

and characterizing user activities. So far, the acquisition of location contexts mostly
relies on human inputs.
Recently, an increasing number of researchers realize that mobility information, as
a new dimension in addition to wireless signals, can be employed to deal with the
three previously mentioned challenges and consequently upgrade indoor positioning to
a higher level [Constandache et al. 2010b; Wang et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2012; Rai et al.
2012; Sun et al. 2013a; Wu et al. 2013a]. It is easy to understand that being aware of
mobility could benefit localization, since location and mobility are by nature related in
the physical world. The current location of a moving object depends on both its past
location and its movements.
In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphone-based
indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what
types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire.
Next, we discuss how mobility assists localization with respect to enhancing location
accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. The enhancement of location accuracy can be seen as a direct result of the add-on of mobility, while
the latter two require more complicated mechanisms. Moreover, considering the quality
and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and
accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences,
we emphasize the principles and conduct a comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and
opportunities in this new and largely open area.
2. WHAT TYPES OF SENSORS

Among various sensors, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are one of the most widely
adopted to measure mobility. An IMU is “an electronic device that measures velocity, orientation, and gravitational forces,” and often constitutes accelerometers and
gyroscopes, and magnetometers [Wikipedia 2014a]. IMUs are primarily designed for
“inertial navigation systems of aircraft, spacecraft, watercraft, and guided missiles”
[Wikipedia 2014a] by means of dead reckoning, which refers to “the process of calculating one’s current position by using a previously determined position, or fix, and
advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and
course” [Wikipedia 2014b]. Modern smartphones also possess various types of inertial
sensors, making them an integrated platform for communication, sensing, and computing. Constrained by cost, size, and power consumption of sensors, however, smartphone
IMUs have their own unique characteristics. In this section, we review the principles,
current development, and future trends of typical inertial sensors on smartphones.
2.1. Smartphone IMU: Principles

Modern smartphones are equipped with various inertial sensors. They compose a simple but workable unit of inertial sensing and are, therefore, considered an IMU of
smartphones. Smartphone IMUs typically include three major types of sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
2.1.1. Accelerometers. An accelerometer is an infrastructure to measure acceleration,
which works as “a damped mass on a spring” [Wikipedia 2014c] leveraging Newton’s
laws of motion. Modern accelerometers are usually micro electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS), and in fact “the simplest MEMS devices possible” [Wikipedia 2014c]. The
SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s2 ), or popularly in terms of
g-force (g). In practice, it also requires local gravity to calculate the actual acceleration
value with respect to the Earth. The value of local gravity can be obtained by device
calibration at rest or gravity modeling given the current position [Wikipedia 2014c].

2.1.2. Gyroscopes. A gyroscope is an instrument to measure or maintain orientation in
principle of angular momentum [Wikipedia 2014d]. It is mechanically “a spinning wheel
or disc in which the axle is free to assume any orientation” [Wikipedia 2014d]. Besides
applications in general navigation, gyroscopes are often exploited in conjunction with
accelerometers to derive robust direction information (e.g., X-, Y-, Z-axis acceleration
with the extent and rate of rotation in roll, pitch, and yaw [Wikipedia 2014d]).
2.1.3. Magnetometers. A magnetometer (or magnetic field sensor), is a device that measures the strength and the direction of magnetic fields [Wikipedia 2014e]. The types
of magnetometers vary. Magnetoresistive sensors and Hall effect devices are the most
popular, yet there is also a huge dispute, both technically and commercially, on the use
of the two for consumer devices.
2.2. Smartphone IMU: Typical Performance

Table I lists the parameters of IMUs of several fashionable consumer electronic devices
ranging from smartphones to tablets. IMU has demonstrated its wide popularity in the
smartphone market. In addition to the latest consumer devices listed in Table I, almost
every smartphone today has a motion sensor embedded inside.
In terms of performance, IMUs are qualified to a large number of services, such as
linking movements of the user’s wrist, arm, and hand to applications; navigation with
and between pages; the movements of characters in a game, etc. However, researchers
and application developers complain that the accuracy of smarpthone IMUs is insufficient for dead reckoning and other location-based services. In fact, compared with
the generally believed accurate IMUs used in Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MUAV)
and other industrial applications, the smartphone IMUs possess the same or similar
core sensing component, but differ in sensor screening, installation error calibration,
cross axis error calibration, zero point correction, temperature drift compensation, etc.
For instance, ADI’s ADIS16405 and ADIS16400 are based on the same ADI’s low cost
sensing elements, but the former is more expensive than the latter. The only two major
differences are the bias temperature coefficient and the sensitivity temperature coefficient. ADIS16405 is carefully calibrated in various temperatures ranging from −40 to
85◦ C, resulting in an increased cost on testing.
The reduced factory-calibration efforts contribute to the low cost of smartphone
IMUs. As gyroscopes have experienced a dramatic drop in cost, the cost of IMUs is
basically acceptable by mainstream smartphones. Yet, researchers have to avoid the
direct use of dead reckoning with low cost sensors, and resort to pedestrian motion
modeling for accurate mobility measurements (Section 3).
2.3. Smartphone IMU: Future Potentials

With advances in sensor design and manufacturing, increasingly powerful sensors of
various types are now available in smartphones at low costs, depending on which novel
applications are rising in response. Accelerometers today can pick up the sound of key
strikes on an alphanumeric keyboard with such precision that a computer program
can determine what keys are being struck; magnetometers can detect the 50/60Hz
magnetic field emanating from a power cord; barometers can notice the atmospheric
change between floors of a building.
Another future trend of IMU is to combine multisensor modules and deploy dedicated
sensor fusion algorithms, thus advancing the quadruple convergence of high accuracy,
small size, efficient energy, and low cost. Motion sensors in consumer and mobile
applications will be dominated by combo sensors, with their revenue hitting $1.4 billion
by 2016, or 71% of the overall market, while that of discrete instruments tends to
shrink gradually [Dixon 2012]. In fact, the six-axis combo sensor has dominated as

a ready substitute for the three-axis design. For instance, the recent MPU-6500 chip
integrates a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and an on-board digital
motion processor [InvenSense 2013]. And manufacturers have joined the combo sensor
race and other pioneer examples include ST’s iNEMO, InvenSense’s MPU-9150, Bosch
Sensortec’s BNO055, Kionix’s KMX61G, Maxim Integrated’s MAX21100, Freescale’s
FRDM-FXS-MULTI-B, MiraMEMS’s DC210, mCube, etc.
Combo sensor IMUs enable in-chip data fusion for accurate motion tracking. Early
industry efforts using rudimentary sample codes available from some sensor manufacturers have been unsatisfactory and some codes of sensor usage are proved to be
vulnerable even in the Android specification. Today, major sensor suppliers have realized that algorithms and software are essential elements of their product offerings.
Independent middleware developers have created sensor libraries that not only provide accurate headings by keeping the sensors in proper calibration, but also mitigate
against the distorting effects of internal magnetic interferences.
Current sensors present metrological measurements of their physical environment
but, without proper perspectives and interpretation, those sensor readings are often
underutilized. Even extracted mobility information can be further refined to infer high
level knowledge such as locations, activities, and behaviors of users, spawning many
applications of context-aware computing in which mobility, as well as user locations, is
considered as key context [Abowd et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2014]. This expands the role
of mobile devices beyond a sensor of physical environments, to an actuator that adapts
its behaviors accordingly.
3. WHAT TYPES OF MOBILITY INFORMATION

The rich inertial sensing modalities on smartphones report numerous instantaneous
motion measurements, such as acceleration, angular velocity, and absolute direction,
via built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass, respectively. To assist indoor localization and navigation, these low level physical displacement and directional measurements are integrated over time and augmented with location context into more
complex human mobility information, such as walking steps, trajectories, locomotion
modalities (e.g., walking and running), virtual landmarks (e.g., stairs and lifts), etc.
Figure 1 illustrates a typical scenario of indoor inertial sensing as well as types of mobility information derivable from phone sensors. However, assembling human mobility
information from phone sensory data is an endeavor fraught with obstacles. We briefly
summarize them into three aspects:
—Noisy sensor measurements. It is inevitable to induce noise in raw sensory measurements. When integrating these physical measurements over time, even small errors

may drift dramatically. For instance, errors accumulate quadratically when deriving
displacement by twice integrating acceleration.
—Unconstrained phone placement. Since most inertial sensors measure motion information, these measurements are sensitive to sensor placements [Harle 2013]. For
instance, acceleration traces exhibit more distinctive patterns with a foot-mounted
accelerometer [Angermann and Robertson 2012] than with a phone accelerometer
put in a bag due to random bouncing of phones.
—Complex human locomotion. Human body can be in various poses, with at least
244 degrees of freedom [Zatsiorsky 1998]. Individuals of different heights, weights,
ages, health states, etc., can exhibit different motion gaits. Furthermore, people may
sometimes behave unpredictably. Therefore, it is challenging to extract consistent
and robust locomotion patterns and accurate mobility information leveraging only
phone sensors.
Since most indoor localization and navigation systems target at pedestrians, we
mainly focus on step and stride (i.e., two steps) related human mobility information,
which is fundamental and specific to pedestrians. In this section, we elaborate the
principles to derive displacement and direction information of step vectors, as well as
integrated and behavioral human mobility information.
3.1. Displacement Information

Step detection and counting is a basic module in most inertial-based pedestrian localization and navigation systems. The physical underpinning is to search for cycles
in acceleration traces to capture the repetitive movements during walking. Figure 2
depicts the raw acceleration traces during a sample walking, which exhibits notable
repetitive cycles. The subsequent sections summarize algorithms for step detection and
counting using phone accelerometers, followed by a brief discussion on the individualspecific stride length.
3.1.1. Step Detection and Counting. When inputting an acceleration trace, step detection
algorithms slice and label the trace into steps exploiting the repetitive patterns of
walking, and the labels are then summed into step counts. We roughly group these
algorithms as follows:

—Temporal analysis. The cyclic property of walking is directly reflected in the acceleration trace in the time domain. Since heel strikes tend to introduce sharp changes,
numerous schemes propose to detect magnitude peaks [Randell et al. 2003; Wu et al.
2013a], local variance peaks [Jimenez et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2012], local minima

[Wang et al. 2012; Sen et al. 2013], zero-crossings [Goyal et al. 2011], or levelcrossings [Zhu et al. 2013] (levels defined by historical mean and variance) from
the low-pass filtered acceleration trace. Autocorrelation is a more robust means to
magnify periodicity in the time domain regardless of the absolute amplitude of acceleration [Rai et al. 2012]. Steps can also be recognized by matching with a stride
template either linearly (e.g., by cross-correlation [Marschollek et al. 2008]) or nonlinearly (e.g., by dynamic time warping [Rong et al. 2007]), yet at a higher cost.
—Spectral analysis. When the acceleration trace contains at least two walking cycles,
it is possible to identify the repetitive walking patterns in the frequency domain. The
rationale is that walking movements would generate dominant frequencies around
2Hz, a unique spectral characteristic compared with other human activities. ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) [Brajdic and Harle 2013] and wavelet transforms
[Barralon et al. 2006; hua Wang et al. 2012] have been employed to extract dominant
frequencies, and steps are counted as the sum of the transform coefficients of the
walking frequency.
—Feature clustering. Besides the previous pattern analysis approaches, research also
resorts to machine learning techniques to classify walking steps via features from
acceleration traces. Various features have been explored, including statistics [Siirtola
and Roning 2012], entropy [Bao and Intille 2004], as well as temporal correlation
[Ravi et al. 2005] and Fourier transform coefficients [Kobayashi et al. 2011]. Albeit
its high computational cost, feature clustering-based schemes are more general and
are often applied to classify multiple human activities beyond walking.
Table II summarizes some recent smartphone-based step counting schemes in terms
of techniques, cost, and performance. We refer interested readers to Harle [2013] for a
review on step counting strategies via non-smartphone IMUs (e.g., foot mounted) and
noninertial sensors (e.g., ultrasonic). Temporal analysis-based schemes are the most
intuitive in concept, and facilitate physical explanation on the extracted feature metrics. The primary drawback is that the cyclic walking patterns are mixed with other
noises in the time domain. Spectral analysis-based approaches offer an orthogonal domain to distinguish frequencies of walking and other noises, yet are less intuitive. For
example, it is difficult to distinguish fine-grained walking patterns such as heel-up
and heel-down directly from the signal spectrum. In addition, the accuracy of spectral
analysis improves with the amount of signal periods contained in the input signal.

Hence spectral analysis often requires more signal samples than temporal analysis.
Feature clustering is agnostic to the underlying physical meanings, yet can provide
higher accuracy given sufficient training efforts. As shown in Table II, one recent work
exploiting a modified autocorrelation scheme in the time domain [Rai et al. 2012] reports high detection accuracy, since autocorrelation techniques increase signal-to-noise
ratio with the increase of input signal length, and the temporal approach facilitates
other auxiliary error correction schemes as the signal features have clear physical
interpretations.
Although step counting accuracy of above 99% is often reported under laboratory
conditions [Harle 2013], unified performance comparison is difficult. A recent study
[Brajdic and Harle 2013] conducted a realistic evaluation of three categories of step
counting algorithms with 27 people and 130 traces. They recommend standard deviation thresholding and windowed peak detection for its simplicity, with a reasonable
error rate of 3% evaluated with six phone placements and six user behaviors. However,
it remains unsettled whether these algorithms would be robust to varying walking
speeds, rough surfaces, etc.
3.1.2. Stride Length Estimation. Knowing stride length is necessary when converting
steps into distance traversed. Pedestrians may exhibit different stride lengths due to
variety in height, walking speed, and style. According to Weinberg [2002], step length
may vary up to 40% at the same walking speed, and 50% with various speeds of the
same person. Assuming constant stride length is efficient when frequent landmark
calibration is available [Wang et al. 2012] or when only a short walking distance is
required [Sen et al. 2013]. Nevertheless, with the emerging trend of crowdsourcingbased indoor localization and navigation [Wu et al. 2013a; Rai et al. 2012; Yang et al.
2012; Shen et al. 2013; Purohit et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2013], walking traces of diverse users are expected to be calibrated and integrated. Therefore, it would boost
the quality of the crowdsourced mobility information by considering individual-specific
stride length. Some pioneer efforts in stride length estimation are summarized as
follows.

—Offline calibration. An intuitive way to estimate user-specific stride length is to divide
a known walking distance by measured step counts. However, since the walking
patterns may not distribute uniformly, this method may induce bias on dominant
walking patterns [Cho et al. 2010].
—Online estimation. Some recent systems also propose to simultaneously estimate
stride length and user locations via an augmented particle filter [Rai et al. 2012].
The rationale is to iteratively select the optimal stride length that fits user traces
and map constraints.
—Stride length modeling. Originated from human kinematics, other studies correlate stride length with step frequency [Margaria and Margaria 1976; Ladetto 2000;
Gusenbauer et al. 2010]. The key observation is that stride length tends to be shorter
when walking slowly rather than fast [Bertram and Ruina 2001]. A simple linear
relationship suffices [Cho et al. 2010], yet the model parameters, which are trained
offline, are specific to walking conditions, such as wearing sport shoes or high heels
[Shen et al. 2013].
Accurate stride length improves displacement estimation, yet the accuracy increase
is often marginal since heading drift typically dominates the errors [Harle 2013]. Alternatively, when combining wireless and inertial-based localization schemes, some
novel explorations have partially eliminated the need to estimate user-specific stride
length via virtual landmark assisted normalization [Shen et al. 2013] or error-tolerant
transforms [Yang et al. 2012].

3.2. Direction Information

The direction of steps during walking is usually obtained by phone gyroscope and compass (magnetometer). The former outputs angular velocities in 3D, which are integrated
over time into direction change (turning), while the latter directly measures the absolute orientation (heading) of the phone with respect to the magnetic North. Although
compasses alone prove to be feasible for outdoor dead reckoning [Constandache et al.
2010b; Wang et al. 2013], the two modalities often work synergistically in the literature
of indoor localization and navigation [Li et al. 2012b; Wang et al. 2012; Rai et al. 2012],
due to the unique challenges indoors and their complementary error characteristics:
—The metal and conducting material indoors can significantly disturb compass readings and lead to short-term heading estimation errors of up to 100◦ [Afzal et al.
2001].
—Gyroscopes remain unaffected by magnetic fields, yet suffer from bias caused by
initial direction [Wang et al. 2012], and the estimated orientation drifts substantially
with time [Sen et al. 2013].
In this subsection, we first review turning estimation via gyroscope, and then summarize how to combine compass with additional sensory modalities to enhance heading
estimation.
3.2.1. Turning. The layout of many indoor environments consists of perpendicular corridors and corners, where pedestrians tend to walk in straight lines and take turns.
Turning information benefits indoor localization systems in a range of aspects. For
instance, being aware of left or right turns resolves side ambiguity in wireless angle of
arrival estimation using linear antenna arrays [Sen et al. 2013]. Turning information
also facilitates stride length estimation [Rai et al. 2012] and serves as landmarks to
assist drift calibration in pedestrian dead reckoning [Wang et al. 2012; Park et al.
2013].
A turn is detected when the relative orientation measured by gyroscopes experiences
an abrupt change. To differentiate changes corresponding to turns from those caused by
noise, only heading changes exceeding a predefined threshold are determined as turns.
In addition, heading changes within only a short time interval are also discarded.
Park et al. [2013] reports precision of about 85% and recall of 100% for turn detection
considering phone placement diversity (messing, calling, swing, and in pockets), device
type (three types of phones), and user difference (eight volunteers). According to Park
et al. [2013], phone placement that introduces back and forth movements deteriorates
the performance of turn detection most.
3.2.2. Heading. The main hurdle for accurate heading estimation via phone compass

is twofold:
—Magnetic offset. Metal and conducting material nearby can disturb the perceived
north of a phone compass, thus leading to offset in heading estimation. Magnetic
offset is location specific, and thus unpredictable beforehand [Rai et al. 2012].
—Placement offset. The compass measures the orientation of the phone, while the
phone’s heading may not be aligned with the moving direction of the user. Thus
placement offset refers to the difference between the phone’s orientation and the
moving direction of the user.
Figure 3 illustrates the magnetic and placement offset when estimating heading of
user motion via phone compass indoors.
Table III summarizes some representative proposals to enhance heading estimation.
While some efforts attempt to filter magnetic offset on consecutive compass readings

[Youssef et al. 2010], others fuse multiple sensors to improve estimation accuracy
[Wang et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012b; Rai et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2013b].
The rationale is to exploit additional sensors (e.g., gyroscopes) to evaluate the compass
readings [Wang et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012b], and rectify heading estimation iteratively
during walking (e.g., particle filter) [Li et al. 2012b; Rai et al. 2012]. According to the
additional sensory modalities utilized, we categorize these schemes as follows:
—Inertial verification. Since multiple inertial sensors are integrated on a single smartphone, they tend to perceive similar movements during walking. For example, compass value is probably valid if the readings of the phone compass and gyroscope
experience a correlated trend [Wang et al. 2012], which assists in discarding compass values containing severe magnetic offset. Acceleration traces, on the other hand,
can be utilized to identify the time when the phone placement is the same to that
when the phone is first put into a pocket, which helps to accurately infer the moving
direction of the user, given the initial phone placement offset [Li et al. 2012b].
—Visual reference. Since modern buildings are mostly rectangular [Steadman 2006],
the straight ceiling edges offer an orthogonal reference to determine heading information. In Sun et al. [2013b], the ceiling edges are extracted from images taken
by phone camera using computer vision techniques. The orientation of the detected
edges relative to the phone is also computed. Together with the absolute orientation of the rectangular building (and thus the ceiling edges), they achieve average
heading precision of 1◦ with arbitrary phone holding poses. Although its heading
estimation accuracy improves by dozens than inertial schemes, the computational

overhead, energy consumption, as well as the perquisite to take photos, impede its
viability.
In summary, while a compass directly provides the absolute directions of phones,
magnetic offset and placement offset considerably deviate compass readings from the
actual moving direction. Recent advances fuse extra sensors with compasses to provide robust heading estimation, yet accuracy still remains a bottleneck for inertialbased indoor localization and navigation systems. One recent work [Roy et al. 2014]
reduces heading estimation error to less than 6◦ by in-depth video-based human walking pattern analysis and magnetic interference localization and isolation, which is
approaching the accuracy of visual reference-based methods. The primary hurdle for
this bottleneck is that inertial-based heading estimation schemes exploit sensors to
perceive the relatively unconstrained human behaviors, making precise walking direction a micromotion that requires subtle identification [Roy et al. 2014]. In contrast,
visual reference-based approaches [Sun et al. 2013b] leverage static landmarks such
as ceiling edges, yet improve estimation accuracy at the cost of computation and energy
consumption.
3.3. Integrated Information

Previous subsections mainly elaborate the principles and methods to derive short-term
displacement and direction information (e.g., steps and turns) from sensory data. In
this subsection, we demonstrate how the instantaneous displacement and direction
information is integrated into more complex human mobility information.
3.3.1. Trajectory. A pedestrian trajectory consists of a sequence of step vectors. While
inertial-based indoor localization and navigation systems require accurate trajectories
to track pedestrians, some recent work [Wu et al. 2013a; Yang et al. 2012] also exploit
comparatively coarse-grained trajectory information to assist wireless localization. In
Wu et al. [2013a], trajectories are utilized to infer whether the wireless fingerprints
from different locations are reachable with each other. Yang et al. [2012] utilize stressfree walking distances, rather than rigid trajectories, to transform the localization
problem from two-dimension floor plan space to a high-dimension wireless fingerprint
space.
Accurate trajectory estimation still lies in the core of various indoor localization and
navigation systems. Besides traditional challenges in calibrating trajectories of a single
user, the emerging trend of crowdsourcing-based localization also poses new challenges
in clustering trajectories from diverse users [Rai et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013].
3.3.2. Locomotion Modality. Awareness of locomotion modalities (e.g., walking or running) and usage behaviors (e.g., text messaging or making a phone call) assists to
construct more elaborated motion models (e.g., adjust stride length estimation or step
counting according to varying speeds and phone placements), thus holding potential
for improving localization and navigation algorithms.
Identifying these behaviors belongs to a subset of the enormous research on activity
recognition [Ravi et al. 2005]. Some recent work has already explored utilizing phone
accelerometers to distinguish different motion modalities (walking or running) [Iso and
Yamazaki 2006; Miluzzo et al. 2008], transportation modes (bus or metro) [Hemminki
et al. 2013], and phone poses (in hand or at ear) [Park et al. 2012].
Though promising, it is inevitable to involve relatively complex machine learning
techniques to differentiate locomotion modalities and phone placements, which incurs
considerable computation and energy overhead. It still lacks comparative studies on
the trade-off between the overhead of distinguishing fine-grained locomotion modalities
and the performance gain on indoor localization.

3.3.3. Context Landmarks. The mobility information measured by sensors, when combined with location context, can provide unique virtual landmarks, which facilitates
recalibration and thus improves localization accuracy. The key observation is that certain building structures would demonstrate distinctive sensor signatures. For instance,
the acceleration readings on an elevator experience a sharp surge and drop at the start
and the stop of the elevator. Wang et al. [2012] investigate such unique acceleration
patterns of stairs, elevators, escalators, walking, and standing, and achieve an overall
false positive of 0.2% and false negative of 1.1%, respectively. If the locations of these
structures are known as prior, they would serve as landmarks to rectify dead reckoning
drifts.
In case of multiple users, mobility information (e.g., trajectories) of different users
can be associated via encounters. These opportunistic encounters (e.g., Alice happened
to meet Bob) can also act as virtual landmarks to calibrate dead reckoning drifts
[Constandache et al. 2010a] (e.g., we can adjust the trajectory of Alice to make her
current location consistent with Bob’s location, since Bob just walked out of an elevator
whose location is known as prior). Such social encounters also help to refine the
plausible locations of users [Jun et al. 2013] (e.g., if Alice met Bob, then we may safely
restrain the potential locations of Alice to the intersection between the potential
locations of Alice and those of Bob).
These novel context landmarks stem from user mobility, and are complementary to
static landmarks (or fingerprints) such as ambient sound, light, and color [Azizyan
et al. 2009]. While some pioneer work has explored incorporating the two (e.g., inertial
patterns + WiFi RSSI [Wang et al. 2012], directions + WiFi trend [Shen et al. 2013]),
its full potential still remains an open issue.
4. HOW MOBILITY ASSISTS LOCALIZATION

WiFi fingerprinting prevails among various wireless indoor localization techniques due
to its wide availability. The general framework can be divided into two phases: training
and operating. The former involves a site survey process (a.k.a. calibration), in which
Received Signal Strengths (RSSs) from multiple APs at every location of interest are
measured and recorded as WiFi fingerprints. Accordingly, a fingerprint database (a.k.a.
radio map) is built, where each location is labeled with its corresponding fingerprints.
In the operating stage, to locate a user sends a query with his current fingerprint;
the localization server retrieves the fingerprint database and returns the location of
the best-matched fingerprints as the user’s location estimation. A typical architecture
of fingerprint-based localization is portrayed in Figure 4. Ever since its birth, WiFi

Mobility Increases Localizability

54:15

fingerprinting is considered static. Human mobility information extends conventional
wireless indoor localization to an orthogonal dimension. In what follows, we will discuss
in detail how mobility enhances wireless localization in terms of accuracy, cost, and
location context.
4.1. Mobility Enhances Localization Accuracy

Despite extensive efforts from both academics and industries in the past decade, localization accuracy remains a primary challenge, especially in mobile environments. While
proof-of-concept innovations report high accuracy under controlled settings [Youssef
and Agrawala 2005; Lim et al. 2006], they can experience sharp performance degradation in practice, with median error consistently above 5m [Turner et al. 2011] and
unacceptable tail errors of 12m to even 40m [Liu et al. 2012].
The root cause of such large errors in WiFi fingerprinting lies in fingerprint ambiguity [Sun et al. 2013a; Liu et al. 2012]. More specifically, a fundamental hypothesis
of fingerprint-based localization is that wireless signal features (e.g., RSS values) vary
at different locations. Each location exhibits exclusive and distinctive signal characteristics, which are analogous to biometric fingerprints and are thus referred to as
WiFi fingerprints of the locations. The ever-increasing number of APs deployed indoors
offers high-dimensional WiFi fingerprints and the potential for more accurate localization performance. One common preprocessing procedure, for example, is to compare
the sets of detectable APs to distinguish WiFi fingerprints from distant locations. However, this approach is often coarse-grained, since locations within room ranges can
share the same detectable AP set due to the relatively large coverage of WiFi signals.
In addition, since not all APs are equally sensitive to location changes, their ability
of discerning locations varies. Therefore, some pioneer efforts [Chen et al. 2006; Fang
and Lin 2012] have explored selecting a subset or transform of more distinctive APs
for higher localization accuracy and energy efficiency. (Note that although AP selection
schemes indeed can improve the accuracy of WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems, such schemes are less relevant to the theme of harnessing mobility to
enhance wireless localization. We thus omit the details and refer interested readers to
Chen et al. [2006] and Fang and Lin [2012] for more details.) Since distant locations
may share similar fingerprints, they may become indistinguishable. To make matters
worse, such ambiguity is intractable as it is scarcely possible to eliminate the uncertainty and instability of signal propagation in the air, given that the multipath effects
are inevitable indoors.
Toward higher accuracy, recent pioneer work exploits physical layer information [Sen
et al. 2012] or incorporate acoustic ranging [Liu et al. 2012, 2013], among others. However, these methods either rely on information unavailable on commodity smartphones,
or resort to unrealistic cooperation among a dense crowd of peers, thus degrading the
ubiquity or increasing the costs.
A promising alternative, is to leverage human mobility information acquired from
built-in inertial sensors. Table IV lists some recent works on improving wireless localization accuracy leveraging mobility. We demonstrate how they combat fingerprint
ambiguity as follows.
4.1.1. Extending Fingerprint Diversity. User motions captured by inertial sensors add to
the diversity of fingerprints generated from RSS observations. Specifically, user mobility indicates the physical relationships between pairs of adjacent locations and extends
the dimension of constraints for location estimation, which helps to distinguish multiple locations with similar RSS fingerprints.
Applying such thoughts, Sun et al. [2013] proposed MoLoc, a system that notably reduces the large errors caused by fingerprint ambiguity. MoLoc employs an

accelerometer and digital compass to determine relative location reachability and accordingly construct a motion database, which is then attached to the traditional fingerprint database. When a user sends a location query with his/her current fingerprints,
MoLoc calculates the most similar candidates, according to the joint probability returned by the RSS fingerprints together with the motion database. MoLoc is an early
attempt to integrate user mobility into localization and proves promising for practical
applications, at the cost of an extra motion database.
4.1.2. Continuous Path Matching. Trajectories of mobile users can also mitigate fingerprint ambiguity. Displacement and/or direction information obtained by dead reckoning impose relative geometrical constraints between consecutive location queries along
a trajectory. With these restrictions, fingerprint matching in localization algorithms
shifts from point matching to line fitting by embedding the entire trajectory into the
radio map, thus contributing to more accurate location estimates.
GloCal [Wu et al. 2013b] is an early attempt to embrace trajectories to enhance
outdoor GPS localization. Noting the trajectories maintained by dead reckoning hold
precise structures (i.e., trajectory shapes), GloCal proposes to align the discretely erroneous GPS readings to the accurate locally monitored traces by coordinate transformation between the global and local coordinate systems. The integration of the local yet
accurate trajectory with the global but erroneous GPS samples significantly decreases
the GPS biases by 30% on average. Although prototyped for outdoor GPS applications,
GloCal can easily be extended to indoor scenarios, by replacing GPS readings with
initial fingerprint-matching results.
A similar idea is adopted in ACMI [Yoon et al. 2013], which employs FM broadcast
signals for localization. ACMI performs path matching to improve localization accuracy,
which clusters multiple indoor spots along a mobile user’s trajectory. The key insight is
that, even though the RSS estimation at each individual location may be ambiguous,
the RSS changing pattern over a broader area may be unique with a higher probability.
To reduce computational complexity of path matching, a walk detector is designed
to monitor the topology of indoor spots, which regulates the distance between two
successive spots to relate only neighboring spots that satisfy the distance constraints.
Experimental results demonstrate that localization errors decrease from 10m–18m to
6m, along with the room identification accuracy from 59% to 89%.
A graph-based data fusion technique based on the well-known particle filter is proposed in Hilsenbeck et al. [2014] to process measurements from multiple sources of
sensor information as well as the knowledge of indoor maps. Experiments on a dataset
that spans about 20km in distance walked within four hours demonstrate excellent
accuracy of 1.52m 50% of the time and 4.53m 90% of the time. Naguib et al. [2013] also

reliable and accurate location estimation with reported median accuracy of less than
1m. Li et al. [2012b] devised algorithms for reliable steps and heading direction detection, and accuracy step length estimation and personalization and reports mean
accuracy of 1.5m for the phone-in-hand case and 2m for the phone-in-pocket case while
integrating these modules with an indoor floor map. The availability of mobility information, even with mere orientation, has enabled accurate WiFi-based SAR (Synthesis
Aperture Radar) on commodity mobile devices, achieving tens of centimeters localization accuracy [Kumar et al. 2014]. Besides WiFi-based positioning, inertial sensor data
is also combined with other radio signals like RFID and UWB [Zampella et al. 2013],
using similar data fusing techniques. In a nutshell, we conclude that embracing inertial
sensed mobility information in indoor localization appears to be an irresistible trend
and inertial sensing will be an indispensable component in future practical positioning
systems for smartphones.
Despite dramatic accuracy improvement, it is not all chocolates and flowers to leverage user mobility in the form of trajectory matching. The main drawback is that it may
incur higher energy consumption as well as longer time delay, which to some extent
limits the efficiency in energy-sensitive and real-time applications.
4.2. Mobility Decreases Deployment Cost

A primary bottleneck of fingerprint-based localization is the process of site survey
(a.k.a., calibration or war-driving) due to its expensive manpower and time overhead.
With the assistance of mobility, this site survey procedure can be liberated from specialists to ordinary users, from dedicated hardware to commodity devices, and most
critically, from conscious labor efforts to unconscious user participation. In essence,
mobility benefits localization by two aspects of power: (1) the potential to associate
previously independent fingerprints or locations and (2) the ability to monitor user
moving trajectories. The former makes it possible to construct the reachability relationship between fingerprints in the fingerprint space, which can then be mapped to
the physical space to obtain the targeted radio map. The latter lays the foundation of
progressive radio map construction from localized trajectories. Inspired by these new
opportunities, many researchers scramble to put forward a number of site-survey-free
solutions to decrease the deployment costs of wireless localization. We roughly summarize them into three categories: fingerprint space transformation, trajectory embedding
with floor plan, and with landmarks.
4.2.1. Fingerprint Space Transformation. In previous literature, wireless fingerprints of
different locations were considered independent from each other. Such independence
serves as an implicit hypothesis for location distinction via fingerprinting [Patwari
and Kasera 2007]. Although these fingerprints may be independent in the wireless
signal space, they can still be associated under certain semantics. Early attempts
consider the relationship between end locations such as connectivity or reachability
between adjacent locations, usually in the form of transition probability matrix and
thus typically modeled by the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [Liu et al. 2010; Zheng
et al. 2008]. Nevertheless, most of them simply assume the availability of the transition
matrix, yet seldom provide details on the feasibility or how to acquire the transition
probabilities.
Breakthrough emerges with the availability of smartphone-based inertial sensing, where various human mobility information, including step counts, orientation,
trajectory, etc., can now be obtained in an automatic, harmonious way without extra hardware deployment or even user attention. LiFS [Yang et al. 2012] pioneers
constructing a connected fingerprint space using inertial sensor hints, which is further
transformed to the physical floor plan to bridge the fingerprints with the corresponding

locations. WILL [Wu et al. 2013a] adopts a similar idea, yet at the resolution of room
level fingerprints. Since WILL can be treated as a special case of LiFS, we briefly
discuss the principles of LiFS in the following.
To construct the fingerprint space, LiFS automatically collects continuous acceleration readings and the accompanying RSS observations, from ordinary smartphone
users during their routine work and living in the buildings. Footsteps are then detected
and counted as in Section 3.1.1 and used as the interfingerprints distance measurements. Feeding the interfingerprint distances to the mMultidimensional Scaling (MDS)
algorithm, a high-dimension space named fingerprint space [Yang et al. 2012] is generated, where the mutual distances between points (which represent fingerprints) are
preserved (Figure 5). The fingerprint space is then mapped to the floor plan to associate the fingerprints with their corresponding locations. The mapping is achieved by
exploring the spatial similarity between the fingerprint space and a transformed floor
plan, called stress-free floor plan[Yang et al. 2012]. The stress-free floor plan is a space
that transforms a normal floor plan into a high-dimension space by MDS, such that
the geometrical distances between the points in the new space reflect their walking
distances instead of the straight distances. The rationale behind such transformation
is that, due to the presence of obstacles such as walls, the walking distance between
two locations does not necessarily equal the geographical distance between them. Both
indicating the walking distance constraints of the same building, the stress-free floor
plan and fingerprint space are highly similar in spatial topology, which finally enables
fingerprints labeled with real locations.
Two key insights motivate the design of LiFS: (1) With user mobility, originally
separated fingerprints can be geographically connected by mobile trajectories, resulting
in the so-called fingerprint space. (2) Although the data of any individual user may be
inappreciable, fusing a large amount of sensor hints from numerous participators can
make a big difference.
Focusing on fingerprint database construction, LiFS achieves remarkable performance with the 95th percentile mapping error being lower than 4m and the average
error of 1.33m. The radio map generated by LiFS is sufficient for use in numerous
fingerprint-based localization schemes, including classical ones like RADAR [Bahl and
Padmanabhan 2000] and Horus [Youssef and Agrawala 2005] and more recent ones like
Liu et al. [2012]. Among all approaches we surveyed that aim to reduce deployment
cost, LiFS is probably the most backward compatible to classical RSS fingerprint-based
localization systems and thus can be easily integrated and serve for many existing and
emerging localization techniques.

4.2.2. Trajectory Embedding with Floor Plan. Considering indoor space, as a user continues to walk and navigate through hallways and and turning around corners, his/her
trajectory grows distinguished especially in shape and thus the similarities for his/her
trajectory shrink progressively. Some researchers exploit this insight and propose
novel techniques for constructing a fingerprint database and estimating user location.
Among these efforts, Zee [Rai et al. 2012] is a most representative system, which
simultaneously estimates user locomotion and location.
Zee enables crowdsourced radio map construction by inferring a user’s location from
his moving trajectory, without any prior about his initial location. Zee estimates a user’s
current location as follows. It initializes the user’s location as a uniformly distributed
probability over all locations within the entire floor. Accounting for the structure imposed by the floor plan, Zee continuously updates the probability distribution when
the user moves on by eliminating all impossible paths that would require the user
to violate the physical walls or other obstacles. If the user walks for sufficient length
and, particularly, takes enough turns, the location probability is promising to converge
to the correct location since there may be probably only one path that can be accommodated to the shape of the trajectory measured from user motion. This procedure is
similar to embed a trajectory with specific shape into a 2D floor plan considering the
physical constraints imposed by the floor plan. To do this, an augmented particle filter
is proposed to track the probability distribution of a user location during his walk. In
particular, to simultaneously estimate location, stride length, and heading offset, Zee
maintains a four-dimensional joint probability distribution function in a particle filter,
and learns all these values as the user walks.
Note that only mobility information is employed but no WiFi measurements are
required during this trajectory embedding process. To eventually generate a fingerprint database, however, Zee still expects users to record WiFi measurements during
their moving paths, which will then be annotated with the locations estimated from
trajectory embedding. Fusing abundant localized walking trajectories from numerous users, Zee is finally capable of building a radio map for WiFi fingerprint-based
localization.
4.2.3. Trajectory Pinning with Landmarks. Given that inertial sensors can capture and
maintain user trajectories in an automatic and noninvasive way, it is possible to infer
user location using only these trajectories as inputs, as long as an initial start point
is known. The idea, typically known as dead reckoning, is not fundamentally different
from ancient transportation and modern robotic navigation systems. However, it is
nontrivial to implement this idea for mobile applications due to error drifts caused by
noisy phone sensors and complicated human behaviors. In consequence, in addition to
notable efforts in reckoning user trajectories as accurately as possible (as in Section 3),
researchers also strive to take advantage of reference landmarks both in outdoor and
indoor environments.
CompAcc [Constandache et al. 2010b] is an early exploration of infrastructureindependent localization for outdoor scenarios. It leverages an electronic compass and
accelerometer to measure the walking displacement and orientation of a mobile user,
based on which a trajectory is produced and further matched against walkable path
segments imposed by a digital map tile. Note a trajectory is a directional trail while
the digital map tile is a local area map downloaded based on the rough location of the
phone. With infrequent GPS samples, the phone can recalibrate its location and uses
it as a reference for subsequent estimations. By doing this, the accumulative errors
arising from the inaccurate sensor readings can be successively resisted.
Translating a similar idea into indoor services encounters remarkable difficulties
because of the unavailability of GPS. And researchers have investigated indoor context

landmarks as a substitution. These context landmarks vary from dedicated installed
reference anchors, to automatically discovered spots (i.e., spots with certain distinctive
signatures). As a seminal endeavor, Unloc [Wang et al. 2012] comprehensively explores and exploits environment landmarks for location estimation. In Unloc, inertial
sensing of human behavior and ambient sensing of environment contexts are simultaneously conducted to discover underlying landmarks, which are further utilized as
reference points, analogous to GPS samples in outdoor scenarios, to recalibrate the
dead-reckoned locations. Unloc looks into a floor plan and identifies seed landmarks
from essential structures in the building. The rationale is that users will be forced
to behave in predictable ways at certain places such as elevators, stairs, building entrances, and escalators. For instance, building entrances are characterized by a visible
drop in the GPS confidence when the user moves from outdoors to indoors; elevators
exhibit a distinct accelerometer signature, emerging from the start and stop of the elevator. Translating these predictable behaviors into sensor signatures, Unloc manages
to identify intrinsic landmarks from smartphone sensor readings. Since the landmarks
are spots with known locations in the floor plan, they can be used to calibrate a user’s
location when he passes through one landmark. On this basis, Unloc can localize a user
at any time by incorporating the established dead reckoning on smartphones, without
building a fingerprint database or injecting extra reference anchors.
In addition to seed landmarks, Unloc also explores more organic yet unknown landmarks by ambient sensing. These landmarks are postulated to be spots that exhibit
distinct ambient signatures across one or more sensing dimensions, which can be magnetism, acceleration, or WiFi domain. Taking magnetic hints as an example, metals
in a specific location may produce unique and reproducible fluctuations on the magnetometer near that location, rendering a possible landmark. Since accurate locations of
such landmarks cannot be known a priori, Unloc employs unsupervised clustering algorithms to identify individual landmarks from a large amount of sensor data gathered
from all phone users. Given a set of seed landmarks available, the incrementally recognized landmarks can then be associated with relative locations via dead reckoning,
which in turn will benefit dead reckoning itself (by providing denser reference points
for calibration). In summary, inertial sensing and ambient sensing hold complementary advantages: The precise trajectory structure preserved by inertial sensing lays
the important foundations to connect individual landmarks, while it is the accurate
location references from landmarks recognized by ambient sensing that put relative
trajectories into a floor plan.
Although both explore user trajectories, Zee and Unloc exploits them in quite different ways, as illustrated in Figure 6. Finally, we present an overall comparison of LiFS,
Zee, and Unloc in terms of localization accuracy, deployment cost, bootstrap latency, the
extent of user participation, and the dependence of floor plan and sensors in Figure 7.

4.3. Mobility Enriches Location Contexts

Location, although generally appearing in the form of numerical coordinates, should
never be monotonous digits. Luxuriant contexts are always accompanied with physical locations, such as location labels, region functionality, surrounding circumstances,
social information, etc. In brief, location, as the most essential element of our physical space, is abundant in its denotation yet rather simple in its basic connotation.
Among various location context information, floor plan is the most essential one that
provides users with a clear and useful view of the indoor space. As for all the localization approaches mentioned previously, floor plan is either a necessary input or a basic
requirement for providing positioning services.
Unfortunately, it is never easy to acquire the rich accompanying contexts of locations.
Even powerful companies such as Google also have to incur hefty costs of manpower,
financial resources, and time to obtain—however, rather limited—location contexts in
the indoor map service project. Requirements of specialized engineers and dedicated
equipment, and the massive amount of buildings, increase both the difficulties and
expenses of generating semantically meaningful indoor maps.
Inertial sensor hints, which act as an efficient interface to obtain user mobility
through smartphones, make it possible to construct an indoor floor plan automatically
and dynamically. A floor plan is a graph that provides the region layout and space
partition of a building. In other words, a floor plan is one way of presenting the indoor
space connections and obstructions. Hence, human mobility, which is constrained to
the indoor space reachability, can in turn reveal the structure of building layouts and
thus it is possible to sketch the floor plan. Generally, the task of portraying a floor plan
is twofold: (1) Space regionalization: partition the entire space into pieces of areas,
which are usually separated by walls or other obstacles. (2) Functionality recognition:
label each partitioned area with a specific category of indoor space function, such as
rooms, halls, stairs, corridors, etc.
4.3.1. Space Regionalization. To partition the entire space, trajectories collected from
different users are fused and joined together to form the basic topology of the floor plan.
One trajectory is spliced with another by exploring the common landmarks they have
both passed through. For instance, if two trajectories both start from the same building
entrance, they can be joined at the start point. Figure 8 illustrates an example of
the incremental generation of the floor plan skeleton, where trajectories are gradually
added and fitted. When embracing sufficient trajectories that cover the entire space, a
drafted floor plan shows up.
Walkie-Markie [Shen et al. 2013] is a recent, successful system that implements the
idea to produce a hallway map. Without a floor plan available a priori, Walkie-Markie
could not search the “seed landmarks” for location estimation even at the very initial

correspond to rooms in reality), and stars represent user trajectories.

stage. Instead, Walkie-Markie explores the novel WiFi-Marks as landmarks for location
reference and calibration. WiFi-Marks are defined as locations where the RSS trend of
a certain AP changes, which prove to be excellent landmarks due to their stability and
robustness. In addition to using the WiFi-defined landmarks to constrain drifting in
dead reckoning, Walkie-Markie further exploits them to align and join different user
trajectories, and eventually produces a hallway map.
While the hallway map can be treated as the side product of Walkie-Markie, CrowdInside [Alzantot and Youssef 2012] and Jiang et al. [2013] completely target at indoor
floor plan generation. In CrowdInside, the procedure is detailed as follows:
(1) Trajectory segmentation. Segments are straight parts of the trajectory that are
separated by either turns or pauses, which are supposed to be inside the same area
(room/corridor).
(2) Segment classification. The module is performed to distinguish segments in the
corridors from those inside rooms. A decision tree-based classifier, using average
time spent per step, segment length, and trace density as inputs, is carried out for
classification.
(3) Segment clustering. A density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, is put on all
segments that are classified as rooms to find the number, boundaries, and center
locations of the unknown rooms.
(4) Shaping. Finally, to estimate the shapes of a room (or the corridors), the α shape is
calculated based on the corresponding point set, that is, points that are associated
with the room.
Similarly, in Jiang et al. [2013], an automatic floor plan construction system based
on room WiFi fingerprints and user motion information, the floor plan is constructed
via three steps: (1) room adjacency graph construction to identify the adjacency of
rooms and construct a room adjacency graph; (2) hallway layout learning to estimate
room sizes and order rooms along each hallway, using crowd-based motion sensing

on smartphones, and (3) force directed dilation to adjust room sizes and optimize the
overall floor plan accuracy.
4.3.2. Functionality Recognition. Once the space is partitioned and identified as individual regions, that is, rooms, halls, or corridors, a higher level of semantic can be
attached to each region to extend the contexts of the generated floor plan. These semantics include region functionality and room types, shop brands in a mall or room
doorplate information, user counts in a specific room, social events, etc. Particularly,
user mobility is closely related to region functionality and room types since user and
crowd behaviors are constrained by specific patterns at certain regions, which is also
the underpinning insight for the feasibility of mining global landmarks for localization
as what Unloc has done. Considering modern office buildings, four types of functional
areas are involved:

—Rooms. User behaviors in office rooms also exhibit particular patterns. Users in
rooms stay stationary most of the time. Even when users move inside the room, their
trajectories are inclined to be short and contain more turns. Moreover, detecting
colocation of people can also further differentiate semantic functions, such as meeting
room, classroom, or normal office room.
—Corridors. Despite a few users may stop for a while in corridors, most of the users
are always walking. Consequently, users do not spend a long time in the corridor. In
addition, user trajectories generated in the corridor are dense, mostly straight and
long, and with fewer turns.
—Elevators. Elevators are distinctive landmarks in a building because Radio Frequency (RF) signals are blocked and the acceleration patterns are unique in the
elevators. The acceleration variance sequence of elevator-taking is defined as follows: a normal walking period, a short dwell time for waiting, walking into the
elevator, a weight-loss (or overweight) period, standing statically inside, followed by
another overweight (or weight-loss), and walking out of the elevator. Figure 9 shows
examples of such elevator motion traces.
—Stairs. At first sight, it is difficult to differentiate between stairs and corridors.
Nevertheless, acceleration patterns provide clues to tell the two apart. For stairs, the
variance of acceleration is much larger, which usually varies from 4m/s2 to 10m/s2
as observed from real user traces.
As can be seen, Unloc and CrowdInside both explore these basic properties of different functional regions in terms of mobility to identify certain spots for landmarks (or
anchors in CrowdInside). CrowdInside further exploits the mobile trajectories to differentiate between rooms and corridors. Regarding those higher level location contexts,
extensive sensing information, beyond mobility, must be incorporated and advanced

pattern recognition or machine learning techniques should be employed. In brief, we
review and envision the solutions to perceive rich contexts for locations.
—Incorporate ambient sensing with various types of sensors built on the phone, including inertial sensors as well as other ones like camera and microphone, to investigate
richer sensing hints, which can be used to fingerprint some locations. SurroundSense
combines such ambient sensing scheme together with inertial sensing to fingerprint
logical locations across multiple dimensions and achieves an average accuracy of
87% when all sensing modalities are employed. Map service products such as Google
Maps and Baidu Maps have employed high-resolution cameras to scan and construct
live indoor station view, which is analogous to the street view for outdoor maps and
thus creates expensive costs.
—Integration with social networks and user visiting patterns. With growing interests
in location-based social networks such as Foursquare, Facebook Places, Whrrl, and
location-based mobile games like Google Ingress, users who explore places, write
reviews, and share their locations would generate plenty of semantic labels. Fusing
and mining these user-generated location tags, it is possible to annotate indoor
locations with rich contexts automatically and precisely [Chon et al. 2012; Lian and
Xie 2011; Ye et al. 2011].
Location contexts are as significant as the location itself, by making location coordinates meaningful, understandable, and eventually attractive as places with distinctive
semantics, visual views, specific people, and/or events of interests, etc. While user mobility sheds light on extending the location contexts with low costs in an automatic
way, it, as an open issue, still requires adequate research attention and explorations.
5. HOW TO HANDLE MEASUREMENT ERRORS

In the context of smartphone-based indoor localization with inertial sensors, diverse
user-phone states constitute the main obstacles that prevent accurate measurement
estimates. For example, unconstrained smartphone placements on users may lower
step detection accuracy with a generic detection model, while stride length deviations
among users make displacement estimation challenging. Therefore, we review existing
works that strive to alleviate these measurement errors from two aspects in this section:
generate estimates by user modeling and statistics; and combine constraints from
external sources.
5.1. Internal Introspection

As discussed in Section 3, basic measurements include step detection, stride length
estimation, and heading estimation. Pioneer works have been conducted on making
step detection and stride length estimation more robust for users, yet few works have
considered the influence of user models for heading estimation. Therefore, we focus
on methods of handling measurement errors in detecting steps and estimating stride
length. Furthermore, as a high level of measurement, user trajectories possess the
potential to alleviate errors and will be discussed.
Step Detection. Most step detection methods can achieve high accuracy of measurements by analyzing temporal or spectral features of sensor data (Section 3.1.1).
These methods are suitable for fixed sensor placement (e.g., waist-mounted and footmounted). However, the interaction between users and smartphones are more complex. Measurement error source points to the diverse smartphone placements as signal
patterns change with placements. The study conducted in Brajdic and Harle [2013]
compared various step detection algorithms for different smartphone placements and
showed that weakness exists for each method. A direction of handling such errors is
to model each placement and apply the detection method accordingly. The placements

Mobility Increases Localizability

can be categorized according to the usual manners of users [Ayub et al. 2012; Susi et al.
2013; Renaudin et al. 2012]:
—Static. The user’s location does not change during the detection phase. For example,
the user may step in the spot when answering the phone.
—Quasistable. The user is walking, while the phone is relatively fixed to the user. For
instance, the user may be texting, playing phone games, or the phone is placed in the
trousers.
—Swinging. The user holds her phone in the normally swinging hand while walking.
—Irregular. All irregular motions not belonging to the previous cases. For instance,
the user is searching in her handbag for the phone.
With the placement modes defined, a simple pattern recognition scheme [Ayub et al.
2012] or machine learning method [Susi et al. 2013] can be adopted to detect placements
automatically. Thereafter, suitable step detection schemes can be selected for specific
placement modes.
Stride Length Estimation. The difficulty of stride length estimation originates from
the diversity of users (such as gender, height, walking speed, etc). Different models have
been proposed to depict important factors to estimate stride length. A Gaussian model
is adopted in Constandache et al. [2010a], where the mean of the stride length needs
to be measured by users manually, and the deviation of the length is set empirically.
The stride length (s) and frequency ( f ) with body fixed sensors are shown to be linearly
related [Margaria and Margaria 1976], which enables a linear model for stride length
estimation [Cho et al. 2010]: s = a· f + b, where a and b are user-dependent parameters.
A more complex model adds a random walk parameter w to estimate step length:
s = a · f + b + w, where w describes the step length asymmetry of both legs [Ladetto
2000] and is modeled using a Gaussian distribution with deviation proportional to the
step frequency [Gusenbauer et al. 2010]. Biomechanical studies show that the user’s
step length and height are directly proportional in general [Rose and Gamble 2006].
Therefore, a linear model explicitly incorporating user’s step frequency f and height h
is proposed: s = h · (a · f + b) + c, where a, b, and c are parameters [Renaudin et al.
2012].
These models all depend on user calibration and thus are more accurate than general
estimation methods, though the calibration phase may be of high cost. While phone
placement modes have been shown to influence step detection accuracy, how they
impact stride length estimation needs further investigation [Ayub et al. 2012].
Trajectory Estimation. User trajectories constitute high level abstraction of sensor
readings and user mobilities. By collecting and merging multiple user trajectories, it is
possible to reveal the spatial characteristics of indoor environment and hence facilitate
localization [Yang et al. 2012; Rai et al. 2012], navigation [Purohit et al. 2013], and
floor plan construction [Shen et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2013]. Different from the outdoor
trajectories, which are mostly GPS and time stamp series, indoor user trajectories
are more challenging due to the complex user-phone interaction and diverse sensor
readings. Therefore, outdoor trajectory estimation and error control methods [Zheng
and Zhou 2011] cannot be directly adopted.
The redundancy of user trajectories brings a new opportunity of measurement error
control. Note that error control discussed previously mainly resort to finer user modeling. However, sensor malfunctioning and abnormal user behavior renders these methods invalid. Numerous user trajectories enable statistical models, especially robust
statistical tools, to filter out abnormal data that may jeopardize the trajectory merging
results [Zhang et al. 2014].
Specifically, given a physical route, each user walking along the route may collect
a trajectory. The goal is to estimate the distance between two sample locations along

the route. A common method is to use the step counts of a user, which is transformed
from the accelerometer readings of a smartphone, to reflect the distance. Yet different
users have different strides, and users may collect outlier data due to multiple reasons
(e.g., a user may cheat the smartphone sensor by abnormal movement). Therefore, it is
necessary to make use of the redundancy of user data to obtain an accurate estimate.
A family of robust statistical estimators are effective in alleviating the influence
of outlier data when acquiring an estimate between sample points. Furthermore, a
multidimensional estimator, termed minimum covariance determinant, is adopted in
Zhang et al. [2014] to estimate the distances among sample points along a physical
route. Interestingly, a unique ID is associated with each user, which is revealed to
be normal or abnormal by the estimation result. The abnormal users hence can be
excluded when estimating trajectories in other routes. This is very essential in the
area where few users step into, as even robust statistical tools may fail in this scenario
For example, if a route has received three trajectories, among which two trajectories
are abnormal and one is normal. It is obvious that no statistical estimator can make an
accurate estimation. However, if we have the ID of these three users and have tracked
their performance in other areas where user redundancy exists, we can still obtain a
satisfiable estimate by eliminating the two outlier users.
Robust statistical methods are promising as more and more mobile trajectory-based
applications are based on crowdsourcing [Wang et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2012; Shen
et al. 2013], yet in large open environments where user movements are difficult to
characterize, it is still hard to obtain accurate estimates. Further efforts are needed to
resolve this issue.
5.2. External Facilitation

Other than handling errors by solely inspecting the sensor data, the measurements can
be further improved by user mobility references, that is, landmarks and floor plans.
5.2.1. Landmarks. The landmarks can be detected from the unique patterns reflected
through smartphone sensor readings. For example, an elevator imposes a distinct
pattern on the smartphone’s accelerometer; while a corridor-corner may only receive
a unique set of WiFi access points [Wang et al. 2012]. These landmarks (or more
accurately, unique signal patterns of landmarks) exist in various places of a typical
indoor environment, making them valuable to assist rectifying a smartphone user’s
positions under motion. The rationale of using landmarks lies in that, the locations of
these landmarks serve as restarting locations for pedestrians, hence dividing a user’s
long trajectories into multiple short trajectories and significantly reducing the accumulative measurement errors from inertial sensors [Li et al. 2012a; Alzantot and Youssef
2012; Shen et al. 2013]. Table V gives a brief summarization of these landmarks.
As the landmarks themselves are reflected from received patterns of sensors, they
are possibly erroneous. However, the uniqueness and large distances from other

nonlandmark patterns make landmarks more robust and accurate than simply using inertial sensor readings. In fact, recent studies even adopted secondary landmarks,
which are summarized directly from user trajectories, to help recalibrate other users’
locations. In Constandache et al. [2010a], beacon nodes deployed in the environment
play the role of primary landmarks and reset users’ positions within the range. And
these users with fresh restarting positions in turn, being secondary landmarks, correct locations of other encountered users. In Wang et al. [2012], primary landmarks
are certain recognizable structures in the building (e.g., stairs, elevators, entrances,
escalators), where sensor signatures are stored in advance; while ambient signatures
across one or many sensing dimensions, which constitute secondary landmarks (e.g.,
a spot not covered by WiFi, a water fountain), are learned dynamically by clustering
more and more users’ sensing data.
5.2.2. Floor Plans. Similar to the idea of applying electronic maps to rectify users’
positions in outdoor localization schemes [Constandache et al. 2010b; Zhu et al. 2013],
integrating the constraints of floor plans alleviates the inertial sensor errors in indoor
localization. There are roughly two means to use a floor plan.
Geometry Mapping. Mapping user trajectories to floor plans is effective in weakening
sensor drift errors. The rationale is that, though user trajectories may be distorted due
to sensor drift, their overall geometric shape should be similar to that of the floor plan.
Different geometric abstraction models can be adopted for mapping. For example, a
link-node model is applied in Lan and Shih [2013], while a stress-free floor plan is
proposed in Yang et al. [2012].
Position Filtering. The other way of using a floor plan is to exclude unlikely positions
for walking users, such as obstacles and walls. A commonly used technique is Particle
Filter, which has been successfully applied in locating mobile robots [Fox et al. 2001]
and pedestrian tracking with foot-mounted sensors [Klepal et al. 2008; Woodman and
Harle 2008]. Table VI summarizes Particle Filters used in pedestrian localization with
smartphones.
Particle filtering is a nonparametric form of Bayesian estimation, which consists of
many particles. In the context of user localization, a typical particle may represent the
user’s possible physical position and heading. Positions and heading values possess
different likelihood. Hence a weight value is assigned to each particle, which reflects
the probability of the particle being correct according to the accumulated information.
Generally, there are three steps to run an iteration of particle filtering:

ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 47, No. 3, Article 54, Publication date: April 2015.

54:28

Z. Yang et al.

—Particle propagation. Particles update their values according to certain motion models. For example, a constant velocity with a Gaussian noise can be used to update
the position of a particle.
—Particle correction. Particles update their weights according to their fitness to the
environment. For example, if a particle crosses a wall during propagation, the weight
of that particle should be set to 0.
—Particle resampling. A new particle set is generated in proportion to the weights of
particles in the current set.
The particle correction step is of great concern in the literature, as external constraints can be added in this step to eliminate inappropriate particles. The basic constraint is the floor plan, which defines the accessible area for particles. Another common
constraint is WiFi fingerprint, which is helpful for differentiating similar particle trajectories [Thiagarajan 2011; Kothari et al. 2012]. A recent study attempted to replace
the requirement for a detailed knowledge of floor plan by using distances to known
reference points (corner, stairs, elevators, and WiFi estimation) to restrain particles
[Radu and Marina 2013].
The influences of particle propagation are twofold: First, the choice of motion models
(e.g., direction error distribution and stride length distribution) is important to ensure
particle survival rate. Specifically, as the number of particles that can be simulated
is finite due to computational constraints, if all particles end up violating a floor plan
constraint, the filter may end up producing no output at all. Toward this issue, mixture
models [Thiagarajan 2011], other than simple Gaussian models [Kothari et al. 2012;
Radu and Marina 2013], are investigated and shown to have a better survival rate.
Secondly, as users have different stride lengths, using a generic model (e.g., Gaussian
model) is inappropriate. In fact, the stride lengths vary even for the same user from
time to time. A direct approach for this problem is to incorporate the stride length, or
the parameters of a personalized step model, as a component of a particle [Rai et al.
2012; Li et al. 2012b].
6. CONCLUSIONS

In this survey, we reviewed the principles of measuring human mobility via smartphones, and the emerging trend in mobility assisted wireless indoor localization. Back
to decades ago, such mobility information was accessible only in the military or robotics
communities leveraging dedicated sensors. Modern smartphones have reshaped the
landscape of human-centric computing and we have identified numerous types of mobility information derivable via built-in sensors. We demonstrated how to incorporate
mobility to improve localization accuracy, decrease deployment cost, and enrich location
context. Due to noisy sensor data, unconstrained phone placement, and complicated
human activities, we also discussed prevalent error control mechanisms for mobility
measurement and localization.
Despite pioneer efforts in mobility measurements and mobility assisted wireless
localization, the realm is still in its infancy and continues to develop from diverse
perspectives.
Orthogonal to inertial sensors, wireless signals can also hint mobility. Seminal work
exploited the ubiquitous WiFi signals to recognize gestures via micro-Doppler effects
[Pu et al. 2013] and estimate walking speed by PHY layer information [Jiang et al.
2014]. Future research is envisioned to incorporate inertial sensors and wireless modules on smartphones synergically to derive mobility information pervasively and nonintrusively.
Previous smartphone-based inertial sensing often abstracts pedestrian mobility as
steps, and ignores that the human body is nonrigid. A notable shift nowadays is to

model detailed locomotion properties based on human kinematics. However, most of
these models are valid only with particular sensor placement (e.g., foot-mounted). It
remains open how to refine them for unconstrained phone placement to capture precise
mobility information and reduce modeling errors.
Another development trend is the finer-grained mobility measurement by smart
wearable devices, such as wristbands, watches, necklaces, glasses, and so forth. Pioneer products like Samsung’s Galaxy Gear and Google Glass have attracted numerous
enthusiasts all over the world. Interworking with smartphones, these smart wearables,
attached firmly to the human body, are holding great expectations of highly accurate
mobility sensing.
Finally, mobility increases more than localizability. The paradigm of localization has
evolved from yielding accurate location coordinates to mining diverse location context.
With mobile users round-the-clock, discrete surrounding information such as ambient
lights, sounds, temperature, air conditions, etc., is now connected via human activities,
social behaviors, and even moods. This in turn extends the connotation of location
context, and brings deeper insight on individuals, societies, and nature. Upon this
promising frontier though, reside significant challenges in integrating complementary
sensing modalities and advancing spatial-temporal analysis with noisy, crowdsourced
data, and these leave largely open and attractive research opportunities.
