1. INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of wireless communication and mobile devices with sensing
capabilities has given rise to mobile and pervasive systems and services that offer novel
opportunities for users behaving and acting in the environment. The range of services,
often referred as location-based (LBS) and context-aware services, have emerged in many
different domains, such as personal navigation, mobile tourist guides, vehicle tracking,
traffic monitoring, pervasive healthcare, emergency management, environment protection,
analysis of animal behavior, etc. [1][2]. At the heart of these services lies the ability to

sense and determine in real-time the location of mobile users [3]. In open space
(outdoors), mobile devices/users are most commonly and accurately positioned by GPS
technology and satellite-based infrastructure that provide location as a point in a
geographic reference system. The current satellite positioning systems are: NAVSTAR
Global Positioning System1, GLONASS2 and Galileo3, which is expected to be fully
operational in 2020. The main disadvantage of GPS-based positioning is its dependency
on a direct line-of-sight with the satellites and thus unavailability in indoor spaces, as well
as in natural/urban canyons. Also, the accuracy of positioning methods based on cellular
networks (e.g. Cell-ID or TOA – Time of Arrival) is not sufficient for use indoors.
Nevertheless, people spend most of their time indoors (80-90% ), in offices, shopping
malls, hospitals, metros, museums, etc., hence the possibility to determine locations and
trajectories of people and objects inside buildings and other closed structures becomes
increasingly important. For advanced indoor LBSs supporting museum/fair guides, fire
rescues, emergency management, or simply ordinary businesses, quality and effectiveness
of services demand knowing immediately where people and resources are inside buildings
and other complexes and how to navigate to certain locations [4]. It is of great importance
to provide seamless integration and handover of different localization technologies while
users move from open space to various closed environments and vice-versa, and efficient
adaptation of indoor LBSs to changing environments, contexts and situations.
With advances in sensor technologies and wireless communications, various indoor
localization methods and systems have been developed over the past years. In indoor
environments, positioning is mainly achieved through the use of radio technologies, such
as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN, Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Zigbee, Ultra-wideband
(UWB), and Radio-frequency identification (RFID), or infrared (IR) and ultrasound
technologies [5][6]. In 2011, twenty-two international companies formed the In-Location
Alliance [7] to standardize and commercialize the indoor localization technologies and
systems. The alliance currently includes large multi-national companies such as Nokia,
Samsung, Qualcomm and Sony, and more than a hundred other high tech companies,
showing the importance of indoor LBS research and development domain.
This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art methods, technologies and systems for
indoor localization and tracking and reviews of some advanced indoor LBS applications
based on these methods and technologies. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes methods and algorithms for pervasive positioning. Section 3 presents indoor
localization systems and technologies, gives their comparative classification, and presents
representative examples of indoor LBS applications. The prominent research directions are
categorized and discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 gives a conclusion.

2. METHODS AND TECHNIQUES FOR INDOOR LOCALIZATION
The core of any localization method relies on the real-time measurement of one to
several parameters, such as angles, distances, or distance differences [8]. Measurement
parameters reflect the location of a target object relative to a single point or several fixed

points in the environment with the known locations. Such parameters are measured using
physical characteristics of electromagnetic radio and infrared signals, as well as
ultrasound signals, such as their travel time, velocity or attenuation. After the determination
of the required parameters, the target object’s location can be calculated using the
measurement results and the known locations of the fixed points.
There are four principal techniques and methods for location calculation and estimation:
 The proximity technique (see Fig. 1a) derives the location of a target object with
respect to its vicinity to the location of the known object(s). A target object receives
the signal from a given node, so the location of the node or the symbolic cell
identification defines the location of a target.
 The triangulation technique uses the triangle geometry to compute locations of a target
object. It is applied via lateration (actually trilateration) (see Fig. 1b), that uses distance
measurements to points with the known locations, or via angulation (sometimes also
referred as triangulation) (see Fig. 1c), which measures angles relative to points with the
known arrangement. Since electromagnetic/ultrasound signals move with the known and
nearly constant speed, the determination of the time difference between sending and
receiving a signal enables computation of the spatial distance between a transmitter and a
receiver. Known distances from three or more transmitters provide accurate positioning
of the target object. For the angulation technique, antennas with direction capabilities are
used. Given two or more directions from fixed locations to the same object, the location
of the target object can be computed.
 Scene analysis techniques involve examination and matching a video/image or
electromagnetic characteristics viewed/sensed from a target object. The analysis of
electromagnetic “scene” sensed by a target object defined by electromagnetic signals
and their strengths from different transmitters, provides the determination of location
using a pattern matching, radio map technique. Using video cameras, a positioning
system can detect significant patterns in a video data stream to determine the user’s
location. If users wear badges with certain labels, they can be detected in video images
and thus localized and tracked in indoor environment covered by a camera. At the
other extreme are techniques involving the matching of perspective video images of
the environment captured by a camera, worn by a person or mounted on a mobile
robot platform, to 3D models stored in an image/video database of the mobile device.
 Dead reckoning techniques provide estimation of the location of a target object based
on the last known location, assuming that the direction of motion and either the
velocity of the target object or the traveled distance are known.

Indoor localization technologies, based on one or more positioning techniques and
methods, possess different characteristics that determine their suitability for specific
indoor LBS and context-aware applications.
Indoor localization and tracking technologies can be based on either an existing
communication network, or a dedicated network/infrastructure that is solely used to
receive/transmit positioning signals. Mobile devices worn by a person or mounted on a
robot can be active when transmitting a signal themselves, or passive when just receiving
a signal. The location can be determined in the mobile device itself, in the wireless
network, or within the dedicated positioning infrastructure.
Indoor localization systems differ in accuracy, precision, scope, the type of determined
location: geometric or symbolic, and the cost. An estimated location is considered accurate if
it corresponds, as much as possible, to the true location of the target object. Precision refers
to the repeatability of the measurement and indicates how sharply a location can be
defined for the sequence of location determinations. The accuracy of a localization system
could be defined by an uncertainty area, i.e. the location is actually defined as an ellipse
(ellipsoid) around the determined location.
An indoor localization system delivers the target object’s location with regard to a
spatial reference system or to a defined symbolic space. Geometric location is determined
in the defined geographic/geometric reference system, such as WGS-84 or a local
coordinate system, and can be either absolute or relative to a reference point. The
localization and tracking of moving indoor objects can be either in 2-D, 3-D, if the object
can be localized in the entire volume of 3-D space, or in 2.5-D, when the object location
is tracked at discrete levels, e.g. floors, of the 3rd spatial dimension. For the purpose of
indoor navigation and tracking the symbolic location is more appropriate. Thus, indoor
localization systems mainly determine symbolic locations in terms of cell identifiers,
buildings, room numbers, objects in the room, etc. Indoor localization systems differ also
in scope of location determination. Since the majority of localization methods depend on
the propagation properties of electromagnetic signals their effectiveness and efficiency
depend on the environment. While satellite-based (GPS) and cellular network-based
positioning systems are intended for outdoor space with the scope that may be the whole
Earth, a certain region or a metropolitan area, indoor localization systems are characterized
by a much narrow scope, such as a university campus, a building or a room. There exist a
variety of indoor localization technologies and solutions intended for indoor spaces that
require some kind of infrastructure that is usually not available in open space. An indoor
localization system determines also the cost needed for a system to be fully operative,
such as the time and space for installation and maintenance of the required infrastructure,
as well as the price of equipment that is required. For example, the need for specialized
hardware and/or network installations, leads to higher deployment and maintenance costs
and poor scalability.
Indoor localization methods and technologies can be classified according to the scope
of infrastructure needed for localization, the type of such infrastructure if any and their
suitability for indoor or limited outdoor spaces. Also, according to the part of the system
where the location is calculated/estimated, i.e., whether a mobile device locates itself or is
tracked, indoor localization systems can be centralized or distributed. All mentioned
characteristics significantly determine the usability of particular indoor localization
technologies for specific indoor LBS applications.

61

Thus, according to the wireless communication and sensing technologies employed,
indoor localization technologies can be classified as:
 Wireless communication-based localization technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UWB,
Zigbee, RFID, IR, ultrasound, etc.) are based on wireless communication or standalone infrastructure (WLAN and WPAN) constrained to indoor and limited outdoor
spaces, providing determination of location either at the mobile device or in the
infrastructure.
 Dead reckoning localization technologies use motion sensors (accelerometer, digital
compass, gyroscope, etc.) and odometers to determine location at the device without
the need for infrastructure, with the scope limited by the accumulated error.
 Video scene analysis represents localization technologies based on the processing of
video signals to detect specific tags in the scene (barcodes) or match the scene with
prerecorded images/video to determine the location at either the mobile device itself,
or to track target objects moving in the scene.

3. INDOOR LOCALIZATION AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS
Over the last twenty years, many indoor localization technologies have been proposed,
developed and experimentally evaluated by both academia and industry that provide
appropriate location data to tracking and navigation capabilities of indoor location-based
and context-aware services. But there is still a lack of wide acceptance and large scale
deployments of indoor localization systems.
The most popular indoor localization systems use Wi-Fi technology, because of wide
availability of Wi-Fi network infrastructure [9]. Wi-Fi positioning systems use a radio
propagation model to determine the distance to the various access points and then
triangulation techniques (TOA, TDOA) to estimate location of a mobile device. Multipath
distortion and variability of Wi-Fi signal strength in time limit the accuracy of such
techniques. Most currently available Wi-Fi positioning solutions are based on the scene
analysis technique, called the fingerprinting technique. The method uses the Received
Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to measure the strength of signals received from the
surrounding access points at discrete locations in space. Such a radio map has to be built
before the system is operational. The calculation of the location consists of measuring the
RSSI from several access points (AP) and then attempting to match these measurements
with the RSSI values of the previously calibrated location points stored in a radio map
database. Depending on the pre-built radio map and the density of calibration points, the
accuracy of the fingerprinting technique is expected to be in the range of 1 to 10 m [6][9].
The major limitation of the Wi-Fi based fingerprinting localization systems is the
construction of the RSSI radio map that needs to be generated in advance and updated
after furniture reallocation, removal/reallocation of the existing access points and
installation of new ones, or algorithmically adapted, as proposed in [10]. The fundamental
problem in Wi-Fi fingerprinting is that heterogeneous mobile devices measure radio
signal strength differently. In that case, either a calibration for each new wireless device is
needed or specialized methods, such as hyperbolic location fingerprinting, presented in
[11], need to be implemented.

One of the first Wi-Fi localization systems was RADAR [12]. Recently many Wi-Fi
based localization systems emerged. Hensen at al. in [13] describe SmartCampusAAU as
a platform that enables indoor positioning and navigation based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting
technique and supports both device- and infrastructure-based positioning. The localization
platform is available on all major mobile platforms (Android, iPhone and Windows
Phone). The work of Laoudias et al. in [14] presents the localization approach based on
signal strength differences, that is more robust to device variations and maintains the
localization accuracy regardless of the number and type of contributing devices. Besides
research works, several commercial localization systems are also available on the market,
such as Ekahau Real-Time Location System [15], Skyhook Wireless [16] and Navizon
indoor location solutions [17].
On the other hand, UWB communication technology has emerged, providing better
positioning accuracy than Wi-Fi. It is suitable for high-precision real-time positioning
using TOA, TDOA, AOA and fingerprinting. UWB signals are less sensitive to multipath
distortion and environment than conventional RF-based positioning systems, so they can
achieve higher accuracy. At bandwidths of at least 500MHz and high time resolution in
the order of nanoseconds, it is possible to obtain accuracy of ranging and localization at
cm‐level [18]. A MUSIC-based method proposed in [19] can achieve high localization
accuracy, in the order of 1 cm, by using spatially distributed antennas that transmit the
same UWB impulse sequence used for self-localization of IR UWB nodes [20]. However,
the high cost of UWB equipment and infrastructure deployment results in its limited
availability for positioning [21]. To date, several UWB positioning systems have been
implemented and deployed, such as the Ubisense system [22] and PulsON [23] system
developed by Time Domain.
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that can be used for localization and tracking,
mainly indoors. Bluetooth positioning systems have similar working principles as the selflocalization schemes of sensor networks. The operation principle of both types of systems
is based on obtaining the range information to anchor devices or access points and
exploring unknown device locations using various algorithms. The majority of the
available research and commercial systems are based on trilateration using the RSSI for
calculating distances between Bluetooth devices, although several reported systems have
explored proximity, cell-based approach. A comprehensive evaluation of all Bluetooth
signal parameters and their suitability for localization purposes is provided in [24].
Bluetooth localization methods are primarily based on RSSI and Link Quality (LQ)
measurements. Cell-based methods rely on the proximity (visibility) of Bluetooth beacons
for determining the location of a device and are gaining popularity with the
implementation of Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) standard. The localization accuracy of the
system is 1 - 5 m (< 0.3 m for Bluetooth LE) and depends on the positioning technique used
and the characteristics (density, layout, etc.) of the deployed infrastructure of Bluetooth
devices and beacons [6][25]. Current examples of Bluetooth positioning systems are
ZONITH Indoor Positioning System [26], TOPAZ [27] and Apple iBeacon [28].
In general, RFID systems are designed so that the reader detects the vicinity of a tag
and retrieves the data stored in that tag. Therefore, the absolute location of the tag is not
known but the RFID system is aware that a tag is placed at a certain range that depends on
the type of the system used, either active or passive RFID [29]. Besides the proximity
technique that provides symbolic location of the tag according to a reader location, there

Indoor Localization and Tracking: Methods, Technologies and Research Challenges

63

are several methods for performing accurate positioning using active RFID technology.
These methods employ techniques such as AOA, TDOA and RSSI that achieves accuracy
in the range of 1-5 m, or even bellow 1m, depending on the density of tag deployment and
RFID reading ranges [30]. The examples of location sensing systems using the RFID
technology are SpotON [31] and LANDMARC [32].
The ZigBee technology is an emerging wireless communication standard for PAN/LAN
intended for applications which do not need significant data throughput, but require lowpower consumption. As such, ZigBee is widely used in smart home environments. The
localization is usually performed using proximity and TOA methods based on distances from
the surrounding ZigBee nodes calculated using RSSI. Several recent research papers
propose and evaluate localization algorithms and systems based on ZigBee achieving the
accuracy of 1-10 m [5]. Larranaga et al. in [33] present a flexible indoor localization
system based on ZigBee Wireless Sensor Networks based on RSSI level measurements.
The localization system consists of two phases: calibration phase, which is performed
whenever a blind ZigBee node needs to be located and actual localization phase with
accuracy 3m on average. Hu et al. in [34] propose an algorithm based on signal
preprocessing and calibration to correct multipath propagation and improve ZigBee based
indoor localization. Bras et al. in [35] describe a ZigBee location protocol, implemented
by reducing end nodes communication intervals and developing a proper router and
coordinator firmware. This protocol provides two localization methods based on proximity
and multi-RSSI reference nodes location that provides support for triangulation and
fingerprinting.
Dedicated positioning methods, commonly based on infrared and ultrasound technologies,
provide a high degree of accuracy, but require expensive equipment limited to a small scale
that usually have high installation and maintenance costs [5]. In infrared (IR)-based systems,
each tracked person is wearing a small infrared device that emits a unique pulse signal
representing its unique identifier. The signals are detected by at least one particular IR
sensor in the vicinity. A location server estimates IR device location by aggregating data
obtained from fixed IR sensors deployed within the indoor environment. The Active
Badge system [36], as the first IR positioning system, works this way and provides
symbolic location information at the room or smaller level depending on deployed IR
sensor infrastructure. Ultrasound-based systems use an ultrasound time-of-flight lateration
technique to provide more accurate physical positioning than by using infrared signals
and sensors. The existence of NLoS (Non Line of Sight) conditions and multipath
propagation in indoor environments are the main problems in the development of reliable
ultrasound-based indoor localization system, achieving accuracy in the range of 1 cm –
1m [37]. The prominent examples are Active Bat system and the Cricket indoor location
system [5].
Many existing indoor localization approaches reviewed so far require infrastructure
(e.g., Bluetooth beacons) to achieve reliable accuracy. There are also passive positioning
systems that do not require specialized infrastructure. Such systems sense naturally
occurring signals or physical phenomena and are based on, for example, magnetic
compasses sensing the Earth’s magnetic field, inertial sensors measuring acceleration and
the heading of an object in motion, and vision systems sensing a scene and its features or
recognizing specific visual patterns (barcodes). In order to be functional they require indoor
map information. Dead reckoning is the process of estimating the current location of a

64

D.H. STOJANOVIĆ, N.M. STOJANOVIĆ

moving device using the location calculated at some previous time instant, and the velocity,
speed or heading estimate till the current time instant. The dead reckoning-based localization
systems, also known as Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), can be used for both indoor and
outdoor positioning. In indoor environment such systems use accelerometers to obtain
human velocity rate information through step detection and step length estimation. Also,
digital compass and gyroscope measurements are used for direction and angular rate
information. All measured data is processed to continuously calculate the location,
direction (bearing), and velocity of a moving object without the need for external references,
but taking into account the known indoor map constraints. On the other hand, the velocity of
indoor vehicles or robots is calculated by appropriate odometers. However, even very small
errors in the rate information provided by inertial sensors cause an unbounded growth in the
error of the integrated measurements, usually referred as the “drift error”.
Dead reckoning based systems have been implemented in various indoor tracking
domains, such as for pedestrian navigation [38] and mobile robot localization [39] [40].
Hardegger et al. in [41] present Smart ActionSLAM, an Android smartphone application
that performs location tracking in home and office environments that uses the integrated
motion sensors of the smartphone and an optional foot-mounted inertial measurement unit to
perform personal localization and tracking. A mobile robot localization system that
combines INS and odometry, and use Kalman filters to estimate the orientation and velocity
of mobile robots to calculate their more accurate positions, is presented in [39]. Localization
systems that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure, or with which such an infrastructure
could be deployed fast by e.g. ultrasound bacons, are particularly suitable for use by
emergency responders such as firefighters. The conditions they work in are significantly
more demanding, caused by darkness, smoke, fire, power outages, etc., so special efforts
have been put to the research and development of appropriate localization and navigation
systems based on dead reckoning, but also ultrasound and RFID [42].
Visual positioning systems use low cost 2D tags (e.g., barcodes) with the encoded
information that can be recorded and processed by a mobile device with a built-in camera,
as in the system proposed in [43]. The symbolic location of a device is estimated by
finding the tag’s identifier and associated location in a deployment database, or by
decoding the location information embedded in the tag itself [44]. Positioning systems
based on video scene analysis are based on computer vision technology to recognize
tracked objects in video data. Easy Living by Microsoft Research provides one example
of this approach [45] where a video surveillance system tracks moving objects recognized
in the video scenes. Also, the mobile device can use video scene analysis to estimate its
location by comparing a snapshot of a scene generated by itself with a number of preobserved simplified images of the scene taken from different positions and perspectives.
An improved performance and sub-meter (1 cm – 1 m) accuracy of camera-based
localization systems has promoted them as promising positioning solutions for
applications in industry, as well as robot and pedestrian localization and navigation [46].
Murillo et al. in [47] present a wearable omnidirectional vision system and a novel twophase localization approach running on it for personal localization and guidance. It is
based on real time visual odometry SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
method adapted to catadioptric images augmented with topological-semantic information.
The important characteristics of indoor localization systems and related technologies
are reviewed in Table 1.

Indoor LBSs deliver local spatially-referenced information and spatial–processing
power to mobile users in accordance with their past, current and predicted location, or to
the locations of the moving/stationary objects of their interest. Depending on services’
requirements and the context of their usage, different indoor localization technologies and
systems are used at the heart of such services. There are a lot of classifications and
taxonomies of location-based services presented in the literature so far [1][48], while new
services continue to emerge. This is an attempt to make a classification of indoor LBSs,
the localization technologies and systems they are based on, and to present some
prominent examples of such applications.

5. RESEARCH CHALLENGES
Localization technologies and location data collection systems provide many
resources for the development of mobile and pervasive computing and applications. Still,
a lot of open issues and future research directions should be explored for the development
of the next generation of location-based applications and services.
5.1. Seamless integration of localization methods and systems
When considering the accuracy, availability and scope of a localization system while
reducing its power consumption and cost, the integration of several localization
technologies and systems is an option that might be relevant in many contexts. The goal
of such integration is to improve the accuracy, availability and scale of single indoor
localization systems while reducing cost. Moreover, the integration should also provide
seamless handover of integrated localization systems that selects the most suitable
positioning method with appropriate accuracy, granularity and resource consumption
according to the user’s context and situation and application requirements. Khider et al. in
[49] present the indoor localization system based on Particle Filter approach and sensor
fusion that combines GNSS, foot mounted inertial sensors, electronic compasses, baroaltimeters, indoor maps and active RFID tags to improve the accuracy and availability of
the determined location. Other examples of integrated indoor localization systems are the
integration of GPS and Wi-Fi based positioning [50], Bluetooth-based positioning and
IR-based positioning technique in Topaz system [27] and a combination of IR and RFID
localization to achieve higher accuracy in healthcare in Versus RTLS [51] .
5.2. Handling massive location data sets
With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technologies, a huge volume of location
data is acquired wirelessly transmitted in the form of continuous data streams that need to
be processed both off-line and online, so called Big Mobility Data. Such data with high
arrival rate must be continuously monitored, processed and analyzed at the server side.
Continuous location data streams define trajectories of moving objects that provide
unprecedented information to understand their mobility and behavior [52]. Within this
research direction, methods and algorithms of mobility data stream management are
investigated, as well as application of high-performance and data-intensive computing
techniques and systems for handling massive trajectory data collections, both on-line and
offline, such as cloud computing techniques (MapReduce), GPGPU (OpenCL, CUDA)
and cluster/grid (MPI) [53].
5.3. Participatory location-based sensing
With the proliferation of mobile phones with increasing sensing capabilities in
everyday use, an important source of sensor data has become the users with their mobile
devices [54]. Thanks to an increasing number of built-in sensors: ambient light,
orientation, accelerometer, sound, camera, velocity, GPS, but also user-generated content
(video, photo, sound, text, etc.), each mobile device can continuously capture, process,
analyze and transmit spatially and temporally referenced data describing the context and
the situation of the user [55]. We need efficient methods, techniques, algorithms and

systems that provide collection, monitoring, processing and analyzing of large volumes of
moving sensor data that define the context and situation in an indoor environment relevant
to a particular application domain [56].
5.4. Semantic location and trajectory data
Once the location of an indoor moving object is known, in either geometric or
symbolic form, many other pieces of information can be inferred to enrich such location
information. The research aims to develop methods and software tools to provide
collection, processing and analysis of indoor location and trajectory semantics. Semantic
locations and trajectories enable development of advanced indoor LBSs which can
provide more intelligent, proactive and valuable services to users navigating in indoor,
but also in outdoor environments [57]. Processing, analysis and mining of semantic
indoor locations/trajectories provide insights in semantics of movement and recognition
of user activities, behavior and prediction of a future movement [52].
5.5. Privacy in indoor location-based services
Although indoor location determination provides many valuable location-based
applications and services to mobile users, revealing people’s locations to potentially
untrusted service providers poses significant privacy concerns. There is a trade-off
between the quality of services offered by an indoor LBS provider and the privacy of a
user’s location. The research in this direction focuses on the protection of sensitive
locations against LBS providers and untrusted members of collaborative geo-social
networks [58]. As such, it is highly related to all other research directions. Releasing
locations and trajectories to the public or a third party could pose serious privacy
concerns, so privacy protection in a LBS and location/trajectory data collection has
increasingly drawn attention from the research community and industry [59].

6. CONCLUSIONS
This paper gives an overview of the methods, technologies and systems involved in
the development of indoor location-based services for mobile users and moving objects
navigated and tracked in the indoor environment. As no localization system is equally
accessible and available everywhere, compromises between accuracy, scope, latency,
privacy and costs may result in a system that seamlessly integrate two or more localization
technologies and systems with regard to the corresponding application domain. For
example, depending on the application requirements, the indoor LBS can employ Wi-Fi
fingerprinting, Bluetooth beacons, and/or dead reckoning technologies to achieve
medium/low accuracy, high availability and coverage, as well as minimal costs for indoor
installations. If the indoor LBS requires higher accuracy within small coverage, there is a
need for extensive node (RFID, infrared, ultrasound, UWB, optical tags, etc.) deployment
and maintenance of a costly infrastructure. Thus, depending on indoor LBS application
requirements the appropriate trade-off between indoor localization characteristics should
be made and integration of localization technologies and systems should be developed.
Research challenges in pervasive localization and tracking cover not only data
collection methods which are reaching a relatively mature level, but also semantic and

technical research avenues where the objective will be to make the best possible use of
the data. This is why location-based and context-aware services and systems are the
object of several exciting research efforts, from semantic to participatory sensing and
privacy, and where several international projects are performed, such as the EU projects
MOVE4 (Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects) and MODAP 5 (Mobility, Data
Mining, and Privacy) [60]. No doubts that other research projects will soon emerge at the
international level as opportunities cover many different location-based application
domains that can be successfully applied to indoor and outdoor environments.
