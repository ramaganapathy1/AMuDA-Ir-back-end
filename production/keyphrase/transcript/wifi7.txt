The advances in localization based technologies and the increasing importance of ubiquitous computing and context-dependent
information have led to a growing business interest in location-based applications and services. Today, most application
requirements are locating or real-time tracking of physical belongings inside buildings accurately; thus, the demand for indoor
localization services has become a key prerequisite in some markets. Moreover, indoor localization technologies address the
inadequacy of global positioning system inside a closed environment, like buildings. Based on this, though, this paper aims to
provide the reader with a review of the recent advances in wireless indoor localization techniques and system to deliver a better
understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and motivate new research efforts in this promising field. For this purpose, existing
wireless localization position system and location estimation schemes are reviewed, as we also compare the related techniques and
systems along with a conclusion and future trends.

1. Introduction
Location based services (LBSs) [1] are a significant permissive
technology and becoming a vital part of life. In this era,
especially in wireless communication networks, LBS broadly
exists from the short-range communication to the long-range
telecommunication networks. LBS refers to the applications
that depend on a user’s location to provide services in various
categories including navigation, tracking, healthcare, and
billing. However, its demand is increasing with new ideas
with the advances in the mobile phone market. The core of the
LBSs is positioning technologies to find the motion activity
of the mobile client. After detection, we pass these statistics
to the mobile client on the move at the right time and the
right location. So, the positioning technologies have a major
influence on the performance, reliability, and privacy of LBSs,
systems, and applications [2].
The basic components of LBS are software application
(provided by the provider), communication network (mobile
network), a content provider, a positioning device, and the
end user’s mobile device. There are several ways to find the
location of a mobile client indoors and outdoors. The most

popular technology outdoors is global positioning system
(GPS) [1]. Location finding refers to a process of obtaining
location information of a mobile client (MC) with respect
to a set of reference positions within a predefined space.
In the literature, many terms are used for location finding
like position location, geolocation, location sensing, or localization [3]. Position system is a system arranged in such a
way to find or estimate the location of an object. The aims
of this paper are to provide the reader with fingerprinting
based wireless indoor localization techniques and systems for
indoor applications. The authors hope that this paper will
benefit researchers working in this field, users, and developers
in terms of using these systems and will help them identify
the potential research shortcoming and future application
products in this emerging area.
1.1. Indoor versus Outdoor Positioning. Positioning system
can be categorized depending on the target environment as
either indoor, outdoor, or mixed type. For localization in
an outdoor environment, global navigation satellite systems
(GNSS) such as GPS have been used in a wide range

2
of applications including tracking and asset management
systems; transport navigation and guidance; synchronization
of telecommunications networks; geodetic survey. GPS works
extremely well in outdoor positioning. Unfortunately, GPS
does not perform well in urban canyons, close to walls,
buildings, trees, indoors, and in underground environments
as the signal from the GPS satellites is too weak to come
across most buildings thus making GPS ineffective for indoor
localization [4].
Indoor positioning [5] can be defined as any system that
provides a precise position inside of a closed structure, such as
a shopping mall, hospitals, airport, a subway, and university
campuses. By the complex nature of indoor environments,
the development of an indoor localization technique is always
associated with a set of challenges like smaller dimensions,
high none line of sight (NLOS), influence of obstacles
like walls, equipment, movement of human beings, doors,
and other factors. Multipath effect signals are reflected and
attenuated by walls and furniture and noise interference [6].
These challenges result mainly from the influence of obstacles
on the propagation of electromagnetic waves. For getting
good and accurate results, a positioning system must be able
to handle these problems. Beside this, higher accuracy is
also required indoors to locate a user at least in the right
room. One of the important aspects indoors is indoor signal
property characteristics. A signal strength pattern around an
access point interference is shown in Figure 1. Some of the
current indoor navigation technologies are listed in Figure 2.

2. Performance Metrics

Figure 2: Indoor navigation technologies.

The performance criteria associated with localization systems
can be classified into the following areas.
2.1. Accuracy. Accuracy (or location error) of a system is the
important user requirement of positioning systems. Accuracy
can be reported as an error distance between the estimated
location and the actual mobile location. Sometimes, accuracy
is also called the area of uncertainty; that is, the higher the
accuracy is, the better the system is.
2.2. Responsiveness. The responsiveness determines how
quickly the location estimate of a moving target is updated.
2.3. Coverage. The problem of determining the network
coverage for a designated area is important when evaluating
the effectiveness of a positioning system. Coverage is closely
related to accuracy. Coverage can be categorized as local coverage, scalable coverage, and global coverage. Local coverage
is a small well-defined, limited area which is not extendable
(e.g., a single room or building). In this case, the coverage
size is specified (e.g., (m), (m2 ), or (m3 )). Scalable coverage
means systems with the ability to increase the area by adding
hardware, and global coverage means system performance
worldwide or within the desired/specified area.
2.4. Adaptiveness. Environmental influence changes may
affect the localization system performance. The ability of the

localization system to cope with these changes is called its
adaptiveness. A system that is able to adapt to environmental
changes can provide better localization accuracy than systems
that cannot adapt. An adaptive system can also prevent the
need for repeated calibration.
2.5. Scalability. Scalability is a desirable property in almost
any system that suggests how well the system performs when
it operates with a larger number of location requests and a
larger coverage. Poor scalability can result in poor system
performance, necessitating the reengineering or duplication
of systems. A scalable positioning system should be able to
handle large numbers of tags without unnecessary strain.
2.6. Cost and Complexity. The cost gained from a positioning
system can arise from the cost of extra infrastructure, additional bandwidth, money, lifetime, weight, energy, and nature
of deployed technology. The cost may include installation and
survey time during the deployment period. If a positioning
system can reuse an existing communication infrastructure,
some part of infrastructure, equipment, and bandwidth
can be saved. The complexity of the signal processing and
algorithms used to estimate the location is another issue that
needs to be balanced with the performance of positioning

systems. Tradeoffs between the system complexity and the
accuracy affect the overall cost of the system.

Location detection

3. Location Detection Techniques and
Location Algorithms
Several different methods are used for location techniques
and algorithms in wireless based localization. Location detection techniques can be divided into three general categories:
proximity, triangulation and scene analysis as shown in
Figure 3.
3.1. Proximity Detection (Connectivity Based Positioning).
Proximity detection or connectivity based is one of the
simplest positioning methods to implement. It provides symbolic relative location information. The position of mobile
client is determined by cell of origin (CoO) method with
known position and limited range [7]. When more than
one beacon detects the mobile target, it simply forwards
the position nearest where the strongest signal is received.
The accuracy of CoO relates to the density of beacon point
deployment and signal range. This method is implemented
with several wireless positioning technologies, in particular,
the system running infrared radiation (IR), radio frequency
identification (RFID) GSM (Cell-ID), bluetooth, and custom
radio devices [3].
3.2. Triangulation. Triangulation uses the geometric properties of triangles to determine the target location. It has two
derivations: lateration and angulation. Techniques based on
the measurement of the propagation-time system (e.g., TOA,
RTOF, and TDOA) and RSS-based and received signal phase
methods are called lateration technique [8, 9]. The AOA
estimation technique is also called an angulation technique.

3.2.1. Angle Based Method

3.2.2. Time Based Methods

Angle of Arrival (AoA)/Angulation. The angle of arrival (AoA)
technique determines the angle of arrival of the mobile signal
coming from a known location at which it is received at
multiple base stations [3]. To estimate position in a 2D
dimension plane, AoA approach requires only two beacons.
To improve accuracy, three beacons or more are used for
location estimation (triangulation). For finding direction,
it requires highly directional antennas or antenna arrays.
Geometric relationships can then be used to estimate the
location of the intersection of two lines of bearing (LoBs)
from the known reference points as shown in Figure 4.
AOA-based techniques have their limitations. AOA
requires additional antennas with the capacity to measure
the angles which increase the cost of the AOA system implementation. In indoor environments, AOA-based methods are
affected by multipath and NLOS propagation of signals, along
with reflections from walls and other objects, so it is not
good for indoor implementation. Due to these factors, it can
significantly change the direction of signal arrival and thus
degrade the accuracy of an indoor AOA-based positioning
system [10].

Lateration/Trilateration/Multilateration. All three terms
(lateration/trilateration/multilateration) refer to a position
determined from distance measurements. Lateration
or trilateration determines the position of an object by
measuring its distance from multiple reference points.
Thus, it is also called range measurement technique. In
trilateration, the “tri” says that at least three fixed points are
necessary to determine a position. Techniques based on the
measurement of the propagation-time system (e.g., TOA,
RTOF, and TDOA) and RSS-based and received signal phase
methods are called lateration techniques [5, 11].
Time of Arrival (ToA)/Time of Flight (ToF). Time of Arrival
(ToA) systems are based on the accurate synchronization of
the arrival time of a signal transmitted from a mobile device
to several receiving beacons as shown in Figure 5. In ToA,
the mobile device transmits a time stamped signal towards
receiving beacons. When it is received, the distance between
the mobile node and the receiving beacons is calculated from
the transmission time delay and the corresponding speed of
the signal.

Figure 5: Positioning based on TOA/RTOF measurements.

ToA method needs precise knowledge of the transmission
start time(s). Due to this, all receiving beacons along with
mobile devices are accurately synchronized with a precise
time source. ToA is the most accurate technique used in
indoor environment which can filter out multi-path effects
[4]. One of the disadvantages of TOA approach is the requirement for precise time synchronization of all the devices.
For time delay measurement, an additional server will be
needed which will increase the cost of the system. Along
with this, increased delay can also be propagated by a denser
environment, in terms of more people.
Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Time Difference of Arrival
(TDoA) techniques are measured between multiple pairs of
reference points with known locations and use relative time
measurements at each receiving node in place of absolute
time measurements illustrated in Figure 6. TDoA does not
need the use of a synchronized time source of transmission
in order to resolve timestamps and find the location. With
TDoA, a transmission with an unknown starting time is
received at various receiving nodes, with only the receivers
requiring time synchronization [5]. Each difference of arrival
time measurement produces a hyperbolic curve in the localization space on which the location of the mobile node lies.
The intersection of multiple hyperbolic curves specifies the
possible locations of the client. Localization using TDOA is
called multilateration.
Round Trip Time (RTT)/Round-Trip Time of Flight (RToF).
It measures the time of flight of the signal pulse traveling
from the transmitter to the measuring unit and back [3]. In
TOA, calculating the delay is by using two local clocks in
both nodes, while in RTT, it uses only one node to record
the transmitting and arrival times. Because of this advantage,
this technology solves the problem of synchronization to
some extent. One of the drawbacks of this method is range
measurements to multiple devices that need to be carried
out consecutively which may cause precarious latencies for
applications where devices move quickly.
3.2.3. Signal Property Based Method. The majority of wireless
localization systems compute the distance to the positioning

device using either timing information or angle based. In
both scenarios, they are influenced by the multipath effect.
Due to this, the accuracy of estimated location can be
decreased. The substitute method is to estimate the distance
of unknown node to reference node from some sets of measuring units using the attenuation of emitted signal strength
[3, 12]. This method can only be possible with radio signals.
Mostly wireless localization systems positioning device using
properties of the received signal, with received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) being the most widely used signal-related
feature. RSSI measurement estimations depend heavily on
the environmental interference, and they are also nonlinear.
These methods work with the WiFi technology. As this
system needs a server for implementation, this technique can
work using only access points which are cheaper than Wi-Fi
routers.

3.3. Dead Reckoning (DR). Dead reckoning is the process of
estimating known current position based on last determined
position and incrementing that position based on known or
estimated speeds over elapsed time. An inertial navigation
system which provides very accurate directional information
uses dead reckoning and is very widely applied [13]. One of
the disadvantages of dead reckoning is that the inaccuracy
of the process is cumulative, so the deviation in the position
fix grows with time. The reason is that new positions are
calculated entirely from previous positions. Research has
been carried out [13, 14] in indoor localization using dead
reckoning.

3.4. Map Matching (MM). This method is based on the
theory of pattern recognition [15] which combines electronic
map with locating information to obtain the real position of
vehicles in a road network. The use of maps is an efficient
alternative to the installation of additional hardware. MM
techniques include topological analyses, pattern recognition,
or advanced techniques such as hierarchical fuzzy inference
algorithms. The authors of [16, 17] present a recent research
work on map matching algorithm based on indoor and LBS,
respectively.

4. Position Systems
This section presents a review of most prominent state-ofthe-art wireless positioning systems as shown in Figure 7.
Our main focus is put on the radio based systems especially
in wireless local area network (WLAN) positioning (Table 1).
Global positioning system (GPS) is the most popular and
worldwide radio navigation system to find the location and
the position of the objects especially for outdoor environment
[18]. However, it does not work well in indoor setups because
the presence of obstacles in the line of sight between the
satellite and the receiver and electromagnetic waves is spread
and attenuated by the buildings and outdoor obstacles [8].
As people spend most of their time in a closed environment
(indoors), GPS is not well suited for indoor positioning
tracking (Table 3).
Infrared radiation (IR) positioning systems are one of
the most common positioning systems that use wireless
technology. The spectral region of infrared has been used
in various ways for detection or tracking of objects or
persons and available in various wired and wireless devices
such as mobile phone, PDAs, and TV [19]. Most IR based
wireless devices uses line-of-sight (LOS) communication
mode between transmitter and receiver without interference
from strong light sources [20]. The main advantage of using
IR based system devices is being small, lightweight, and easy
to carry out. The IR systems undertake an indoor positioning
determination in a precise way. Besides these, IR based indoor
positioning systems have some disadvantages like security
and privacy issues. IR signals have some limitations for
location determination, like interference from fluorescent
light and sunlight [4]. Beside this, the IR based indoor system
has expensive system hardware and maintenance cost.
Radio frequency technologies [21] are commonly used in
location position systems because of some advantages; for
example, radio waves can penetrate through obstacles like
building walls and human bodies easily. Due to this, the
positioning system in RF based has a larger coverage area and
needs less hardware comparing to other systems. In addition,
RF based technologies are further divided into narrow band
based technologies (RFID, bluetooth, WLAN, and FM) and
wide band based technologies (UWB) [19]. RADAR [22]
by Microsoft Research was the first RF based technique for
location determination and user tracking.
Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been recognized as the next promising technology in serving the positioning system for locating objects or people. RFID enables
a one way wireless communication using a noncontact and
advanced automatic identification technology that uses radio
signals that put an RFID tag on people or objects, for the
purpose of automatic identification, tracking, and management. Tracking the movements of objects in RFID is done
through a network of radio enabled scanning devices over a
distance of several meters. RFID technology is used in a wide
range of applications including people, automobile assembly
industry, warehouse management, supply chain network, and
assets without the need of line of sight contact [9].
Bluetooth is a wireless standard for wireless personal
area networks (WPANs). Almost every WiFi enabled mobile

5
device, such as mobile phone or computer, also has an embedded bluetooth module. Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. The benefit of using bluetooth for exchanging
information between devices is that this technology is of
high security, low cost, low power, and small size. Each
bluetooth tag has a unique ID, which can be used for locating
the Bluetooth tag. There are several recent research works
dedicated to bluetooth based localization systems [23, 24].
One of the drawbacks of using bluetooth technology in
localization is that, in each location finding, it runs the device
discovery procedure; due to this, it significantly increases the
localization latency (10–30 s) and power consumption as well.
That is why bluetooth device has a latency unsuitable for realtime positioning applications.
Ultrawideband (UWB) is a radio technology for shortrange, high-bandwidth communication holding the properties of strong multipath resistance. Widespread use of UWB
in a variety of localization applications requiring higher
accuracy 20–30 cm than achievable through conventional
wireless technologies (e.g., radio frequency identification
(RFID), wireless local area networks (WLAN), etc.) [25]. A
typical UWB setup structures stimulus radio wave generator
and receivers which capture the propagated and scattered
wave. Moreover, UWB hardware is expensive, making it
costly for wide-scale use.
The FM radio based system is popular through the ages.
It is widely available across the globe especially in most
households and in cars. FM radio uses the frequency-division
multiple access (FDMA) approach which splits the band into
a number of separate frequency channels that are used by
stations. FM band ranges and channel separation distances
vary in different regions. There are only a few works dedicated
to FM radio based positioning. Recently [26, 27] presented
research that worked on indoor positioning using FM radio
signals.
The ZigBee technology is an emerging wireless technology standard which provides solution for short and medium
range communications due to its numerous benefits [28]. It
is mainly designed for applications which require low-power
consumption but do not require large data throughput. The
signal range coverage of a ZigBee in indoor environments
is typically 20 m to 30 m. Distance calculation between two
ZigBee nodes is usually carried out from RSSI values. ZigBee
is open to interference from a wide range of signal types using
the same frequency which can disrupt radio communication
because it operates in the unlicensed ISM bands. Hu et al. [7]
deployed a ZigBee based localization algorithm for indoor
environments. Beside this, Fernández et al. [29] proposed
a way to improve the position determination in an indoor
location system (ILS) based on the power levels (RSSI) of an
ad hoc ZigBee network.
Hybrid positioning systems are defined as systems for
determining the location of a mobile client combining several different positioning technologies [30]. Many location
technologies are used to estimate the position of mobile client
in a space or grid, based on some mathematical models. The
local positioning systems fail to work outdoors, whereas the
GPS based positioning systems do not work inside buildings
due to the absence of line of sight to the satellites. So, there

is a need for positioning systems that can work both indoors
and outdoors, and hence, the concept of hybrid positioning
systems is used [31]. Different hybrid positioning systems
are currently being developed and used in services from
Combain Mobile, Navizon, Xtify, PlaceEngine, SkyHook,
Devicescape, Google Maps for Mobile, and sopenBmap for
application in smartphones.
Ultrasound system is a technology based on the nature
of bats and operates in the low frequency band compared to
the other two signaling technologies. The ultrasound signals
are used to estimate the position of the emitter tags from
the receivers. Ultrasound is unable to penetrate walls but
reflects off most of the indoor obstructions. However, it has
a lower level of accuracy (in centimeters) and suffers a lot
of interference from reflected ultrasound signals propagated
around by other sources such as the collision of metals.
Some recent research work [32, 33] was carried out under
ultrasound based indoor localization.
4.1. WiFi-Based Indoor Localization. One of the advantages
of using WiFi Positioning Systems is to locate the position
of almost every WiFi compatible device without installing
extra software or manipulating the hardware. Beside this, in
WLAN, line of sight is not required. Due to this advantage,
WiFi positioning systems have become the most widespread
approach for indoor localization [11].
Most positioning systems based on WLAN (WiFi) are
available as commercial products as prototypes based on
measurements on the received signal strength (RSS). WiFi
based positioning systems have several advantages.
Firstly in terms of cost effect, WLAN infrastructures
implementation of position algorithms does not need any
additional hardware as network interface cards (NICs) measure signal strength values from all wireless access points
in range of the receiver. Therefore, signals needed for positioning can be obtained directly from NICs available on
most handheld computing devices. Due to the ubiquity of
WLANs, this mode of positioning provides a particularly

cost-effective solution for offering LBS in commercial and
residential indoor environments [34]. Secondly, WLAN positioning systems offer scalability in two respects: first, no costly
requirement of infrastructure and hardware and second the
number of mobile devices subscribing to positioning services.
Beside this, there are also certain WLAN limitations: signal
attenuation of the static environment like wall, movement of
furniture and doors. Some of the WiFi strengths, weaknesses,
and opportunities are presented in Table 2.
4.2. Fingerprinting Based Indoor Localization. Most indoor
localization approaches adopted fingerprint matching as the
basic scheme of location determination. The main theme is to
collect features of the scene (fingerprint) from the surrounding signatures at every location in the areas of interest and
then build a fingerprint database. The location of an object is
then determined by matching online measurement with the
closed location against the database [35] (Figure 8).
This method does not require specialized hardware in
either the mobile device or the receiving end nor is no time
synchronization necessary between the stations. It may be
implemented totally in software which can reduce complexity
and cost significantly compared to angulation or purely timebased lateration systems [34].
The location fingerprinting also called a fingerprinting
method consists of two phases [5]. Phase 1 is the so-called
calibration phase, offline phase, or training phase, and phase
2 is the localization phase or online phase. In the offline
phase, maps for fingerprinting are set up either empirically
in measurement operations or computed analytically (signal
strength reference values (anchor point) can be computed
using a signal propagation model). In the first phase, a
creation of radio maps for site survey where the positioning
is supposed to work must be recorded. Basically, radio map
is a database of spots at predefined points (coordinates)
coupled with various radio signal characteristics, for example, RSS, signal angles, or propagation time called signal
fingerprints. Step by step, for every fingerprint, there must

station measures signal properties at unknown spot. Then,

the best agreement with a database (radio map). The major

time-consuming calibration process. Furthermore, adding
signal stations would challenge the ease of setup in fingerprinting. Beside this, the main challenge to the techniques
based on location fingerprinting is sensitivity to environment
changes such as object moving into the building (e.g., people,
furniture), diffraction, and reflection, which result in changes
in signal propagation. To maintain the positioning accuracy,
the calibration process should be periodically repeated to a
recalculation of the predefined signal strength map.
Fingerprinting-based positioning algorithms using pattern recognition techniques are deterministic and probabilistic, K-nearest-neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks,
Bayesian inference, support vector machine (SVM), or their
combinations.
In this part of paper, we are presenting some recent
research work done on WiFi localization with a specific focus
on fingerprinting-based localization technique.
Different approaches using WiFi access points are studied
from time to time. Pereira et al. [36] developed a functional
application for a smartphone indoor/outdoor localization
system publicly available for download with a name called
“Locate Me.” It was developed for mobile devices running
Android OS and takes advantage of the GPS and WiFi
modules to acquire the location of a person. With this
system, anybody can find their friends wherever they are.
The application sends the current location of the device
to the server where it is stored. From that moment on,

of localization, three for indoor environments and one for
outdoors. The fingerprint localization method is used for
indoor location.
Indoor localization using WiFi based fingerprinting and
trilateration techniques for LBS application is presented by
S. Chan et al. [37]. The paper combined two different WiFi
approaches to locate a user in an indoor environment. The
first method involves the use of fingerprint matching to
compare signal strength data received from nearby access
points (AP) by the user, to the reference data stored in the
WiFi signal strength database. The second approach uses

distance-based trilateration approach using three known AP
coordinates detected in the user’s device to derive the position. The combination of the two steps enhances the accuracy
of the user position in an indoor environment allowing
location based services (LBS) such as mobile augmented
reality (MAR) to be deployed more effectively in the indoor
environment. An improvement is necessary for finding the
correct match for the fingerprinting method with help of
incorporating certain database correlation algorithms such
as K-nearest-neighbor or probabilistic like a hidden Markov
model.
In [38], the authors design a multifloor indoor positioning system based on Bayesian graphical models (BGM).
In this paper, the author first studied the RSS properties
that will affect the overall accuracy of our model like a

normal distribution of RSS, using RSS in infer location,
and multifloor effect. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling techniques are used. At the last stage, the author
tested their model with four sets of MCMC sampling techniques and compared their results with two well-known
location determination systems (RADAR and the Horus).
The achieved accuracy is 2 : 3 m in a multi-floor environment
with a small amount of training points.
By using Wi-Fi, it is possible to define the position of
people or assets with good accuracy. In [39], the authors
proposed a novel positioning algorithm named predicted
K-nearest-neighbor (PKNN) which estimates the current
position of a mobile user not only by using K found neighbors
but also by utilizing its previous positions and speed. In the
first stage of the experiment, weighted K-nearest neighbors
(WKNN) are used for the position of the tag which is to be
estimated. In the second stage, prediction is done for the next
probable displacement, based on previous user positions and
speeds of Wi-Fi tags. The performance of PKNN for indoor
positioning has been evaluated by the experimental test bed.
By comparison with KNN, PKNN performs well by 33% or at
mean 1.3 meter improvement in error.
A novel, information-theoretic approach is presented by
Fang and Lin [40] for building a WLAN-based indoor positioning system based on the location fingerprinting system.
The proposed technique is based on principal component
analysis (PCA) which transforms received signal strength
(RSS) into principal components (PCs) such that the information of all access points (APs) is more efficiently utilized.
Instead of selecting APs for the positioning which was done
by previous researchers, the proposed technique changes the
elements with a subset of PCs improvement of accuracy and
reduces the online computation. The comparison has been
done with AP selection and the Horus system. The proposed
approach delivers a significantly improved accuracy. The
results show that the mean error is reduced by 33.75 percent
and the complexity is decreased by 40 percent.

Received signal strength indication (RSSI) is defined
by the IEEE 802.11 Standard. It is a measurement of the
RF energy, and the unit is dBm. Mobile client (MC) can
get the RSSI from access point (AP) on the WLAN. The
RSSI is decreased exponentially as the distance from AP
increased, and this can be expressed by log path loss model.
Reference [41] has been presented, using Dominant AP’S
RSSI Localization (DARL) algorithms. Using dual log model
because of attenuation factor, the parameters are classified
into two parts. Firstly, DARL algorithm uses the strongest
RSSI from an AP. Secondly, AP trace-back algorithm was
suggested as the method for updating the information of
unknown AP on the radio map. Optimal filtering system to
the proposed algorithm is needed for getting more increased
accuracy.
Fingerprinting accuracy performance depends on the
number of base stations and the density of calibration points
where the fingerprints are taken. Recorded RSSI varies in
time, even if there are no changes to the environment.
In order to eliminate the deviation of attenuation in the
signal, the RSS values are to be averaged over a certain time
interval up to several minutes at each fingerprint location.
Hansen et al. [42] draw on active user participation relying
on the contribution of end users by marking their location
on a floor plan while recording the fingerprints. The author
concludes from long-term measurements over a period of
two months that static radio maps cannot be used for room
identification even in modest dynamic environments and
therefore recommends dynamically adapting algorithms.
In [43], the author presents the design, implementation,
and evaluation of a fine-grained indoor fingerprinting system
(FIFS) as shown in Figure 5. Data are modulated on multiple
subcarriers at different frequencies and transmitted simultaneously in Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM). The author takes the value that estimates the
channel in each subcarrier called channel state information
(CSI). Different from RSSI, CSI is a fine-grained value from

10
the PHY layer which describes the amplitude and phase on
each subcarrier in the frequency domain. To obtain high
accuracy and low complexity of indoor localization, the FIFS
was comprised of two parts: first, the process of raw CSI
values of measurement by integrating frequency diversity
(amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths) and
spatial diversity of location using multiple antennas, and
then it builds up a radio map; second, determining the
position of objects by correlation calculation augmented with
a probability algorithm. An experiment is done in two typical
indoor scenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs. The
median accuracy of 0 : 65 m is improved compared with the
RSS-based Horus system 0.2 with gain of about 24%.
Aboodi and Tat-Chee [44] proposed an indoor positioning algorithm called WiFi-based indoor (WBI) positioning
algorithm. WBI-based on WiFi received signal strength (RSS)
technology in conjunction with trilateration techniques. The
WBI algorithm estimates the location using RSS values
previously collected from within the area of interest using
LSE algorithm, determines whether it falls within the MinMax bounding box, corrects for nonline-of-sight propagation
effects on positioning errors using Kalman filtering, and
finally updates the location estimation using least square
estimation (LSE). The paper analyzed the complexity of the
proposed algorithm and compares its performance against
existing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed WBI algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 2.6 m.
The authors of [45] proposed a GPS-Like zeroconfiguration indoor positioning system based on received
signal strength (RSS) of the popular WiFi network as
shown in Figure 9. The proposed system does not require
a time-consuming offline radio survey prior knowledge
about the area or new hardware unlike current RSS-based
indoor systems. Similar to GPS, the proposed system consists
of three sections as shown in Figure 9: network segment
(WiFi), control segment, and user segment. Between
network segment and control segment, RSS observations
are exchanged periodically. The control segment uses a
novel hybrid propagation modeling (PM) technique using
logarithmic decay model augmented by a nonlinear Gaussian
process regression (GPR) that models RSS residuals that
cannot be modeled by the traditional logarithmic decay
models indoors. The proposed system provides 2-3 m
accuracy in indoor environments.
Yang et al. [46] proposed a wireless indoor localization
approach called Locating in fingerprint space (LiFS). In
fingerprinting method, radio base requires a process of
site survey, in which radio signatures of an interested area
are marked with their real recorded locations. Site survey
involves intensive costs on manpower and time and is vulnerable to environmental dynamics. The author investigates
the sensors integrated in modern mobile phones and user
motions to construct the radio map of a floor plan, which is
previously obtained only by site survey. On this basis, they
design LiFS, an indoor localization system based on off-theshelf WiFi infrastructure and mobile phones. An experiment
was performed in an office building covering over 1600 m2 ,
and the results show that LiFS achieves low human cost, rapid
system deployment.

IEEE 802.11n is an amendment to the IEEE 802.112007 wireless networking standard to improve network
throughput over the two previous standards—802.11a and
802.11g—with a significant increase in the maximum net
data rate from 54 Mbit/s to 600 Mbit/s. It also improves
WLAN standard in terms of network throughput by adding a
technology which supports multiple antenna configurations,
known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Xiong
and Jamieson [47] presented ArrayTrack, an indoor location
system that uses angle-of-arrival techniques to locate wireless
clients indoors in a wireless local area network. ArrayTrack
combines best of breed algorithms for AoA based direction
estimation and spatial smoothing with novel algorithms for
suppressing non-line-of-sight reactions that occur frequently
indoors. Based on simulation, ArrayTrack achieved median
25 cm location accuracy when clients are stationary indoors.

5. Conclusion and Future Trends
This paper surveys the recent advances in wireless indoor
localization techniques and system. Different technological
solutions for wireless indoor positioning and navigation are
discussed, and several tradeoffs among them are observed.
Regardless of the plenty of approaches which exist to handle
the indoor positioning problem, current solutions cannot
cope with the performance level that significant applications
required. In short, requirements for different application
environments are accuracy/precision, coverage, availability,
and minimal costs for local installations. To achieve this
shortcoming, a good portion of research approaches is
required to handle these challenges. Some of the future trends
of wireless indoor positioning systems are as follows:
(1) new hybrid solution for positioning and tracking
estimation in 4G with the currently available position
system,
(2) need of cooperative mobile localization which will
help mobile nodes among each other to determine
their locations,

Journal of Computer Networks and Communications
(3) new innovative applications for mobile in which location information can be used to improve the quality of
users’ experience and to add value to existing services
offered by wireless providers.
