Abstract—In this paper, an overview of antenna design for passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags is presented. We
discuss various requirements of such designs, outline a generic design process including range measurement techniques and concentrate on one practical application: RFID tag for box tracking in
warehouses. A loaded meander antenna design for this application
is described and its various practical aspects such as sensitivity to
fabrication process and box content are analyzed. Modeling and
simulation results are also presented which are in good agreement
with measurement data.
Index Terms—Antennas, passive modulated backscatter, radio
frequency identification (RFID), tags, transponders.

I. INTRODUCTION

R

ADIO FREQUENCY identification (RFID) is a rapidly
developing technology which uses RF signals for automatic identification of objects. Although the first paper on modulated backscatter (basic principle of passive RFID) was published in 1948 [1] it took considerable amount of time before
the technology advanced to current level [2]. Now RFID finds
many applications in various areas such as electronic toll collection, asset identification, retail item management, access control, animal tracking, and vehicle security [3]. Several standards
of RFID systems are currently in use (ISO, Class 0, Class 1, and
Gen 2).
Globally, each country has its own frequency allocation for
RFID. For example, RFID UHF bands are: 866–869 MHz
in Europe, 902–928 MHz in North and South America, and
950–956 MHz in Japan and some Asian countries. A typical
passive RFID transponder often called “tag” consists of an antenna and an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip.
RFID tags can be active (with batteries) or passive (batteryless).
A passive back-scattered RFID system operates in the following way. A base station (reader) transmits a modulated signal
with periods of unmodulated carrier, which is received by the tag
antenna. The RF voltage developed on antenna terminals during
unmodulated period is converted to dc. This voltage powers up
the chip, which sends back the information by varying its front
end complex RF input impedance. The impedance typically toggles between two different states, between conjugate match and
some other impedance, effectively modulating the back-scattered signal. Fig. 1 illustrates a passive RFID system operation.

Proper impedance match between the antenna and the chip
is of paramount importance in RFID. Since new IC design and
manufacturing is a big and costly venture, RFID tag antennas
are designed for a specific ASIC available in the market. Adding
an external matching network with lumped elements is usually
prohibitive in RFID tags due to cost and fabrication issues. To
overcome this situation, antenna can be directly matched to the
ASIC which has complex impedance varying with the frequency
and the input power applied to the chip.
Several papers have been published on RFID antennas for
both passive and active tags, including covered slot antenna
design [4], circular patch antenna analysis [5], meander antenna
optimization [6], planar inverted F-antenna [7], folded dipole
antenna [8], etc. However, very few papers [9] provided an
overview of criteria for RFID tag antenna design and an analysis of practical application aspects. At the same time, there
exist many papers on practical analysis and design of particular
classes of antennas used for other applications [10]–[12].
In the current article, we attempted to fill the existing gap.
We reviewed design requirements for passive UHF RFID tag
antennas, outlined the design process, described range measurement techniques, and proposed a performance chart for tag analysis. We also presented a specific application example: a passive
UHF tag design for a RFID tag placed on a cardboard box that
is being tracked in standard supply chain. The design is a versatile loaded meander antenna which can be easily tuned for boxes
with various content like dry goods or plastics. This example is
supplemented with modeling and simulation results which are
in close agreement with measured data.
II. ANTENNA DESIGN
A. Performance Criteria
The most important tag performance characteristic is read
range—the maximum distance at which RFID reader can detect the backscattered signal from the tag. Because reader sensitivity is typically high in comparison with tag, the read range is
defined by the tag response threshold. Read range is also sensitive to the tag orientation, the material the tag is placed on, and
to the propagation environment.
The read range can be calculated using Friis free-space formula as

Qualitative behavior of antenna impedance, chip impedance,

tradeoffs between antenna gain, impedance, and bandwidth.

gain. The normalization factor for this performance chart can
be easily calculated for any case of EIRP and threshold power
of the chip for a given frequency.

B. Design Requirements
Several general RFID tag design requirements whose relative importance depends on tag application are discussed in the
following paragraph. These requirements largely determine the
criteria for selecting an RFID tag antenna.
1) Frequency band. Desired frequency band of operation
depends on the regulations of the country where tag will
be used.
2) Size and form. Tag form and size must be such that
it can be embedded or attached to the required objects
(cardboard boxes, airline baggage strips, identification
cards, etc.) or fit inside a printed label.
3) Read range. Minimum required read range is usually
specified for different:
EIRP. EIRP is determined by local country regulations.
Objects. Tag performance changes when it is
placed on different objects (e.g. cardboard boxes
with various content), or when other objects are
present in the vicinity of the tagged object. Tag antenna can be designed or tuned for optimum performance on a particular object or designed to be less
sensitive to the content on which the tag is placed.
Orientation. Read range depends on antenna orientation. Some applications require a tag to have a
specific directivity pattern such as omnidirectional
or hemispherical coverage.
4) Applications with mobility. RFID tag may be used in
situations where tagged objects like pallets or boxes
travel on a conveyor belt at speeds up to either 600
ft/min or 10 mph. The Doppler shift in this case is less
than 30 Hz at 915 MHz and does not affect RFID operation. However, the tag spends less time in the read field
of RFID reader, demanding high read rate capability. In
such cases, RFID system must be carefully planned to
ensure reliable tag identification.
5) Cost. RFID tag must be a low-cost device. This imposes restrictions both on antenna structure and on the
choice of materials for its construction including the
ASIC used. Typical conductors used in tags are copper,
aluminum, and silver ink. The dielectrics include a flexible polyester and rigid PCB substrates like FR4.
6) Reliability. RFID tag must be a reliable device that can
sustain variations due to temperature, humidity, stress,
and survive such processes as label insertion, printing
and lamination.
C. Design Process
RFID tag antenna performance strongly depends on the frequency-dependent complex impedance presented by the chip.
Tag read range must be closely monitored in the design process
in order to satisfy design requirements. Since antenna size
and frequency of operation impose limitations on maximum
attainable gain and bandwidth [13], [14] compromises have to
be made to obtain optimum tag performance to satisfy design
requirements. Often a tunable antenna design is preferable to
provide tolerance for tag fabrication variations and for optimizing antenna performance on different materials in different
frequency bands.

Fig. 4.

RFID tag antenna design process.

RFID tag antenna design process is illustrated on a flow chart
shown in Fig. 4. Once the RFID application is selected, system
requirements can be translated into tag requirements. These requirements determine the materials for tag antenna construction
and ASIC packaging. The impedance of the selected ASIC in a
chosen RF package (like flip-chip, etc.) to which antenna will
be matched can be measured with a network analyzer.
Antenna parametric study and optimization is performed
until design requirements are met in simulation. Like most
antennas, RFID tag antennas tend to be too complicated for
analytical solution as they can be used in complex environment.
Tag antennas are usually analyzed with electromagnetic modeling and simulation tools, typically with method of moments
(MoM) for planar designs (e.g. thin flexible tags) and with
finite-element method (FEM) or finite-difference time-domain
method (FDTD) for more complicated three-dimensional designs (e.g. thick metal mounted tags). Fast EM analysis tools
are crucial for efficient tag design. In a typical design process,
modeling and simulation tools can be benchmarked against
measurements. Read range calculation can be implemented directly in EM software. Tag antenna is first modeled, simulated,
and optimized on a computer by monitoring the tag range,
antenna gain, and impedance which give to a designer a good
understanding of the antenna behavior.
In the last step of the design process, prototypes are built and
theirperformanceismeasuredextensively.Ifdesignrequirements
are satisfied, the antenna design is ready. Otherwise, the design is
further modified and optimized until requirements are met.
D. Range Measurement
Accurate tag range measurement can be conducted in a controlled environment, such as anechoic chamber or transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) cell. In both methods tag position can be
fixed and transmitter output power can be varied by controlled

chambers or cells. Compact TEM cell is a convenient tool for
measuring small tags while larger anechoic chamber can be used
to measure tag performance on various objects.

The general guidelines for selecting the tag position in anechoic chamber are the following: i) the distance must be such

multipath is minimal.

Consider a specific application: a smart label for cardboard
box labeling in warehouse environment worldwide. Such a label
with a bar code printed on it and an RFID tag embedded underneath can be placed on cardboard boxes with various contents.
Boxes may travel on a conveyor belt as shown in Fig. 7 or may
be moved through large portals by forklifts equipped with RFID
readers. Requirements to the tag design are the following:
•
Tag should be easily tunable to any frequency in
860–960 MHz range for various contents in the final
assembly when the tag is inserted into a label and
placed on a cardboard box.
•
Tag should have at least 2.5 m range with 4 W EIRP in
915 MHz band (902–928 MHz frequencies, US) and
at least 2.2 m range with 2 W ERP (3.3 W EIRP) in
868 MHz band (866–869 MHz frequencies, Europe)
to meet worst case application requirements.
•
Tag should fit into a standard 6 4 inch label. It is
desirable to have as small footprint as possible to fit
into 4 2 inch and 4 1 inch labels for other potential
applications.
•
It is preferred to have omni-like read range performance for a tag.
B. Antenna Design
The process of antenna design is briefly described below.
•
Materials. Because of cost and application considerations, it was decided to use for the antenna a thin flexible polyester substrate with a dielectric permittivity of
3.5 and a thickness of 2 mil (0.051 mm). Top antenna
trace was made of copper and had a thickness of 0.7
mil (0.018 mm).

ASIC. For this smart label application, we used Philips
EPC 1.19 G2 RFID ASIC chip [16] mounted on antenna terminals as shown in Fig. 8 using flip-chip packaging [17] which has been widely established as a popular low-cost technique.
The input impedance of the packaged chip was measured in the frequency domain with the network analyzer for different power levels. It was determined with
RFID reader that the minimum power needed by the
chip to turn on is 10 dBm, which agreed with manufacturer specifications.
Antenna type. The antenna geometry is shown
in Fig. 9. Because of the size and tunability requirements, meandered dipole antenna was a natural choice.
Meandering allowed the antenna to be compact and
to provide omnidirectional performance in the plane
perpendicular to the axis of the meander. To have a
better control over the antenna resistance, we added
one loading bar with the same width as the meander
trace. To provide a better match for the chip capacitive
impedance, one meandered section was further meandered to obtain additional inductance. This antenna
can be easily tuned by trimming. Lengths of meander
trace and loading bar can be varied to obtain optimum
reactance and resistance matching. The trimming is
realized by punching holes through the antenna trace
at defined locations. Such tunable design is desirable
where it is often needed to provide a solution for a
particular application with a minimum lead time.
Parametric study and optimization. The loaded meander antenna has several key parameters: loading bar
width , distance , spacing , meander step width ,
and meander step height . Maximum allowed antenna
length is dictated by the size requirements. The pa-

rameters mentioned above influence antenna gain and
impedance which determine tag resonance, peak range,
and bandwidth. This thin planar antenna was optimized
using Ansoft Designer. Tag range was computed from
and impedance
(1) using simulated values for gain
and measured values for chip impedance
at the
threshold power. Although Ansoft software had a powerful parametrics and optimization engine, its post-processing capabilities were not sufficient to create an adequate cost function for our design requirements. The
optimal realizable combinations of tag antenna parameters were identified by plotting and examining the families of curves. After optimization, we arrived to the final
parameter values for tag antenna given in Table I.
Antenna reactance and resistance can be controlled
by trimming as it is illustrated in Fig. 10. For example,
mm moves
trimming the meander trace by
the resonant frequency up by 20 MHz. The gain is
not significantly affected by trimming as it is shown
in Fig. 11. The performance of the untrimmed tag is
also shown on the chart in Fig. 3.
Prototyping and validation. Several tag prototypes
similar to the one shown in Fig. 12 were fabricated and
tested in both anechoic chamber and TEM cell range
measurement setups.
Fig. 13 presents a comparison between theoretical
and experimentally measured read range for one of the
tags tuned to 915 MHz band in free space. It can be
seen that theoretical curve and experimental data are in
close agreement. Differences between TEM cell data
and anechoic chamber data are due partially to imperfections of anechoic chamber and partially to electric
field nonuniformities inside TEM cell.

Sensitivity to chip variations. Tag design must meet
range requirements in spite of variations in ASIC assembly and packaging process. Because all fabrication details may not be known in advance, the tag resonant frequency after fabrication may differ significantly from the expected value.
To provide sufficient tolerance for tag resonant frequency, our meander antenna is designed to resonate
in free-space with a typical chip impedance shown in

Fig. 10 at about 855 MHz. This ensures that when the
tag is placed on the box, it covers the lowest RFID band
(866–869 MHz) even if fabrication process causes significant resonant frequency deviation. The tag antenna
can always be trimmed to a shorter length whereas extending its length after the fabrication is not easy.
After the prototypes were fabricated, it was found
that the spread of the tag resonant frequency is about
20 MHz as shown in Fig. 14. This spread was caused
by the flip-chip attachment process which affected the
package parasitics and added variations to the imaginary part of the packaged chip impedance.
Sensitivity to box content. When the tag is placed
on a cardboard box with some content, its resonance
frequency shifts down but the tag can be trimmed and
tuned to the proper frequency and range performance
as shown in Fig. 15. The corresponding trimming of the
meander trace and the loading bar is shown in Fig. 16.

Meander tuning for various box content in 868 MHz band.

Once the tuning is determined, it can be applied to
all tags destined to work for specific box content in specific frequency band. The presented tag design meets
the desired range requirements for various box contents in both 868 MHz and 915 MHz frequency bands.
IV. CONCLUSION
Radio frequency identification is a rapidly developing technology for automatic identification of objects. In this paper, we
presented an overview of antenna design for passive UHF RFID
tags. We discussed various requirements to such designs, outlined a generic design process including range measurement
techniques, and concentrated on one practical application, RFID
tag for box tracking in warehouse. We presented a loaded meander antenna design for this application and analyzed various
practical aspects such as its sensitivity to fabrication process
and box content. We also presented modeling and simulation
results which were in good agreement with measurement data.
The analysis presented here can also be applied to active tags
and tags operating at other frequencies.

Comments on “Antenna Design for UHF RFID Tags: A
Review and a Practical Application”
Yuri Tikhov

In [1], the authors discuss the generic design process for passive UHF
Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag antennas. The attempt to
formulate the key universal criteria for the tag antenna design looks
really interesting. In this connection the most important characteristic
of every UHF RFID system is a read range r —the maximum practical
distance between an interrogator base station (reader) and a transponder
(tag). Accordingly, the basic considerations are focused on the read
range formula given in [1] as (1)

r=


4

P t Gt G r 
Pth

(1)

where  is the wavelength, Pt is the power transmitted by the reader,
Gt is the gain of the reader antenna, Gr is the gain of tag antenna, Pth
is the minimum threshold power necessary to provide enough energy
feeding for the tag chip, and  is the power transmission coefficient
due to the impedance mismatch between tag antenna and chip. Indeed,
the far-field formula (1) is correct subject to assumption that polarization of reader antenna and the polarization of tag antenna are perfectly
matched. But in fact, the polarization mismatch is essential in most
RFID applications.
The point is that in the majority of applications the tag is allowed to
appear in almost arbitrary position in the field of the reader antenna.
Actually in [1] authors mention the problem of tag orientation, but just
in the specific context of a directivity pattern. However, the polarization issue becomes also critical. And the polarization of the tag antenna
is usually linear because of pre-required small size of the tag. In such
situation the only way to fulfill a system requirement is to use circularly polarized reader antenna. Thus, a sacrifice of 3-dB power loss due
to polarization mismatch between circularly polarized reader antenna
and linearly polarized tag antenna overcomes the problem of tag orientation. This is why nowadays the major vendors (such as [2]–[5] and
many others) offer mainly circularly polarized reader antennas.
At the same time the linearly polarized antennas are also available
in the market for limited RFID applications. In the case of linearly polarized both reader and tag antennas, the substantial polarization misalignment may cause severe power loss which in its turn can potentially
lead even to fault of RFID system at all.
Therefore, considering polarization issues, in order to avoid overestimation of the read range the formula (1) needs revisions. Definitely,
in the most conventional case of circular-to-linear polarization mismatch the read range r should be (1= 2) times shorter. In the case
of linear-to-linear polarization mismatch the decay factor is a function
of the variable misalignment angle. The chart in [1, Fig. 3] should be
corrected accordingly.

Besides, it is worth mentioning that formula (1) is invalid at nearfield distances between reader and tag. And the near-field situation can
frequently happen in practical UHF RFID application scenario.
Regardless of above-mentioned inaccuracy, the qualitative value of
the work [1] can be definitely very helpful for designers of passive UHF
RFID tags.

Tags: A Review and a Practical Application’”
Pavel V. Nikitin and K. V. S. Rao
The first issue raised by Dr. Tikhov in his Comments [1] is missing
polarization mismatch factor in (1) of our work [2]. We agree that polarization mismatch is an important factor in communication links [3].
We also would like to point that (1) gives the maximum distance in free
space at which RFID reader can detect the backscattered signal from a
given tag which implies that both reader antenna and tag antenna are
oriented towards each other in the direction of maximum gain and their
polarizations are matched. To make (1) more general, one can indeed
include in it both the polarization efficiency p (which accounts for polarization mismatch) and the dependence of antenna gain on the angles
(; '). The modified read range equation would then be given by

In the most general case, both reader and tag antenna are elliptically
polarized with mutually tilted major axis of the polarization ellipses
which lie in the planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
The polarization efficiency p can be expressed as [4]

where 1 ej# and 2 ej# are the complex polarization ratios of the
reader antenna and the tag antenna. The absolute value  of the antenna
polarization ratio is related to the antenna axial ratio A (measured in

There are several special cases of interest for RFID applications. When
both antennas are linearly polarized and oriented with a misalignment
angle , the polarization efficiency is p = cos2 . When the reader
antenna is circularly polarized and the tag antenna is linearly polarized,
p
the polarization efficiency is 1=2 which decreases the read range by 2
as correctly pointed out by Dr. Tikhov.
Dr. Tikhov also mentions that (1) is invalid at near-field distances.
We agree with that but would like to emphasize again that (1) gives
the maximum distance at which RFID reader can read the tag in free
space. In most UHF RFID systems, this distance extends well into the
far-field zone. This is reflected in the very form of (1) which uses Friis
free-space transmission formula valid only in the far-field region [5].
While some tag application scenarios involve near-field tag scanning,

1907

it can be expected that in most cases the tag which can operate in the far
field should receive more than adequate power to operate when brought
closer to RFID reader antenna into the near field. Hence, the read range
of most UHF RFID tags is determined by the tag performance in far
field.
We would like to thank Dr. Tikhov for his valuable Comments [1]
which helped to clarify some aspects of our work [2] and make it more
useful for tag antenna designers and other RFID community.
