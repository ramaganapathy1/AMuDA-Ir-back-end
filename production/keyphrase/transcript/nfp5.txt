Abstract—Localization is one of the most challenging and important issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), especially if
cost-effective approaches are demanded. In this paper, we present
intensively discuss and analyze approaches relying on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The advantage of employing the RSSI values is that no extra hardware (e.g. ultrasonic or
infra-red) is needed for network-centric localization. We studied
different factors that affect the measured RSSI values. Finally, we
evaluate two methods to estimate the distance; the first approach
is based on statistical methods. For the second one, we use an
artificial neural network to estimate the distance.

I. INTRODUCTION

A

CCORDING to Moore's law, each year electronic devices
become cheaper and smaller. Connecting huge numbers
of small embedded systems, one is able to create powerful
massively distributed systems. The best-known examples are
wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Such sensor networks consist of a number of sensor nodes, possibly reaching hundreds
or thousands of connected devices. Each node is a small computing device, which has the capability of sensing and computing in addition to the ability to communicate with other nodes.
Wireless Sensor networks represent one of the emerging research domains. There are many applications for WSNs in
military domains but also in civil applications such as habitat
monitoring and emergency applications.
In this paper, we study and discuss short ranged RSSI based
distance measurement and localization methods and possible
improvements for a mobile robot. We introduce two methods
for distance estimation based on the RSSI value; the first approach is a statistical method and the other one is based on a
trained feed forward artificial neural network. For experimental tests, we developed a prototype using BTnode sensor
nodes1 and the mobile robot system Robertino.2 One single
BTnode is connected on top of the robot acting as a base station of the WSN. This has the main advantage that we can rotate and move the base station as well as changing the RF parameters during our measurements. Thus, we can investigate

the influence of antenna orientation, signal strength, and local
disturbances on the distance estimation in more detail as if we
would use a static base station. Additionally, the robot is supplied with a database of fine-grained RSSI/distance pairs that
have been gathered by performing many calibration runs.
II. RELATED WORK
In the last few years, several approaches have been presented for indoor localization as well as for outdoor use. Maybe the most famous localization method is to measure the time
of flight (ToF) of radio frequency (RF) signals, which is for
example used in GPS systems. Usually, this method cannot be
applied in WSN due to the short distance and the much too
inaccurate time synchronization of the sensor nodes. Cricket
motes exploit this fact and send RF and ultrasonic signals assuming the RF signal has no delay and measure the ToF for the
ultrasonic signal [9]. RADAR is a user tracking system [2]. It
uses empirical as well as mathematical models to determine
the signal strength. Calamari uses RSSI and acoustic ToF to
estimate the distance [11]. It uses an audible frequency to reduce the complexity of the system. SpotON is a RSSI based ad
hoc localization system for WSNs [4]. It can be used for relative and absolute position determination. In this system, all the
nodes need to be calibrated before being used. MoteTrack
focuses on a robust, decentralized implementation [7] as the
most localization systems need a base station for data
processing. The majority of the nodes take over only a limited
role in the localization process to support the case that one or
more base stations are down. Additionally, the localization of
mobile systems has been addressed [5, 10].
III. CONSIDERATIONS ON RSSI BASED DISTANCE ESTIMATION
All signal strength-based localization systems, in particular
indoor, must consider errors in the measured values, which
result from multi-path propagation, reflection, and fading effects. At the execution time of the first measurements, there is
limited relation between the RSSI value and the real distance.
In addition, there is a set of influencing factors, which can be
controlled and exploited for improved measurement results.
A. Antenna characteristics and orientation
The used antennas are regarded to forming sources with

D. Experimental Setup
Our lab is an area of 5x8m with desks, workstation computers and shelves (see Fig 1). In the middle there is a free area of
about 3.5 x 5.0m. Our experiments take place here, since our
main focus is to examine short range RSSI deviations under
standard conditions for indoor localization (keeping the overall
applicability in mind).

Fig 1. In the lab environment, a great number of objects may influence
the radio transmission

In our lab, we are using BTnode sensor nodes, which employ a Bluetooth interface and a 433-915MHz low power radio
chip CC1000. The nodes are equipped with an Atmel ATmega128L microcontroller running at 8MHz and 128Kbyte flash
memory. For our measurements, we also used the mobile robot
system Robertino. This robot carries a PC104 board running
Linux. It is able to perform all the localization algorithms de-

A. Statistical Aspects
First, we examined the characteristics of the RSSI. For the
Chipcon CC1000, the RSSI is recorded with an analogue signal (0–1.2V) that is inversely proportional to the input signal
level. Using a frequency of 868MHz, the readings from the
AD converter can be converted to dBm:
VRSSI[V] = ADC x 2.56V / 1024
P[dBm] = -50.0 x VRSSI – 45.5dBm
We used the robot to request some data packets with arbitrary distance and saved the respective RSSI values. In this
experiment, the distance between the robot and the sensor
node was 2.2m. First, the RSSI values were observed for a
time period of 120s.

C. Variation of the Frequency
Small changes of the wavelength can lead to different developments of the fading effects caused by reflection. Thus,
the dispersions caused by inappropriate frequency under the
given basic conditions must be considered. Therefore, also the
observation of the signal strength under different frequencies is
a subject of the accomplished experiments.

B. Variation of the transmission power
The transmission power and the frequency determine the
maximum range of the radio waves. While the maximum
transmission power might be appropriate for long distance
communication (disregarding energy requirements), differences in the RSSI are hardly visible for small distances between
transmitters and receivers. However, the measurement of short
distances for the localization in closed areas with small dimensions is important. Thus, the transmission power must be wellcontrolled for meaningful RSSI based distance measurements.

spherical radiation. Typically, signals are sent in the frequency
range between 868 MHz and 915 MHz, thus, the antennas are
about 8.3 cm (λ/4) long. Usually, it is assumed that the signals
on their way from the transmitter to the receiver spread in all
directions equally – otherwise, measurements of the mutual
orientation would have to be admitted. Since we cannot determine mutual orientation but we do assume the fact that the
orientation directly exerts influence on the RSSI, a method is
needed to compensate the orientation effects.

RSSI

Fig 2. Variation of the RSSI values over 120s

In Fig 2, it is to be recognized that the measured values vary
strongly under identical conditions. It is noticeable that from
the range of RSSI values between 15 and 45 actually only 9
different values were measured. It is to be therefore assumed
that the resolution of the RSSI does not cover the complete
range of values. A further problem is that in two minutes only
very few packets are sent. The bottle neck is the packet
processing in the sensor node.
In another experiments it showed up that a transmitter can
send between 170 and 180 packets in 30 seconds. The packet
size (maximum 255 byte + 7 byte header) does not influence
the speed. Therefore, it must be examined whether the evaluation of fewer RSSI values is statistically relevant. In a second
attempt under identical conditions, we measures RSSI values
over 20s (see Fig 3).
The comparison of both histograms shows differences in the
distribution of the RSSI values. Nevertheless, the statistical
properties need to be considered. A comparison of the statistical data shows that both measurements exhibit similar characteristics as depicted in Table I. For the localization system

it is crucial that a small number of measurements supplies relevant results, since we need data from many different nodes.

B. Distance dependency
In the next experiments, we examined how the RSSI values
change with different distances. The past results suggest that
small number packets can supply meaningful results. Therefore, in each experiment we used 60 packets to determine the
RSSI values for distances of 1m and 3m. This range was selected to judge the relevance of indoors locations. The measurement environment was a hall in our sports center. A smaller range of the RSSI values is to be expected according to
fewer reflection surfaces compared to our lab.
The expected decrease of the range of values did not appear
in the changed environment (see Fig 4 and Fig 5). We assume
that the quality of the used antennas caused this strong dispersion. One recognizes besides that the distance difference of 2m
has little influence on the measured RSSI values. A comparison of the statistic data of both series of measurements confirms this impression. With 3m, a tendency is recognizable
toward the higher RSSI values. However, this change is so
small that inverse mapping of the RSSI on the distance would
be connected with a large error.
C. Adjustment of the transmission power
Without modification, BTnode transceivers use a frequency
of 868 MHz and a maximum power of 5 dBm. With a low
quality antenna, they have an effective transmission range of

about 20m. For indoor localization, the transmission power
should be adapted to cover the complete RSSI, so that one can
expect sharp demarcations also between small distances. If the
transmission power is regulated to the lowest value (-20 dBm),
then the effective range lies below 1m, which is too small for
distance measurement purposes. In an experiment, we compared a medium transmission power (-4 dBm) to the full
transmission power as used before. Again, we measured distances of 1m and 3m.
From Fig 6 and Fig 7, it could be recognized that there is a
clear shift of the range of values toward the higher RSSI. Especially for the 3m experiment, the desired effect occurred.
The statistics show clear changes in the recorded values.
However, we will describe later that a simple interpolation
between two reference values is not sufficient to reach an adequate illustration of the RSSI on the distance.

In the next attempt, two different frequencies of 863.5MHz
(λ 0.3474m) and 869.9MHz (λ 0.3449m) are compared regard-

ing the quality of distance approximations. In this experiment,
a number of measurements were done automatically by the
robot. It drove over a distance of 5m in steps of 50cm toward a
sensor node. In each step, it requested 60 packets on the two
frequencies and stored the RSSI values. The results are depicted in Fig 8 and Fig 9.
During this experiment, a high standard deviation is recognizable in the range between 2.0 and 3.0m for the lower frequency. Thus, the median is less meaningful regarding the
distance, even if it rises almost straight-lined over a wide range
with increasing distance. The minimum represents a much better distance indicator.
The RSSI values of the higher frequency exhibit a smaller
difference between maximum and minimum for each individual step. The standard deviation of this series of measurements
is small for all distances. With exception of the first and last
hops minimum and median ascend with increasing the distance. Two further series of measurements, which were accomplished with higher transmission power however under the
same conditions, exhibited a very similar pattern regarding the

F. Smoothness of RSSI measurements
A further important aspect is the resolution of the RSSI. In
order to evaluate the quality of the RSSI to distance mappings,
measurements must be done in much smaller steps. In the following experiment, the distance increment of the robot is reduced to 10cm per step resulting in altogether 50 measurements, each one for 60 packets. Additionally, the robot rotated
with each measurement around its axis.
The results as depicted in Fig 11 show that it needs about
0.5m to see somewhat higher RSSI values. In all measurement
groups, a strong increase of the standard deviation and the
maximum RSSI can be observed. These values should not be
considered for the compensation calculation.

In the ranges between 0.5m and 1.0m as well as between

the distance. The measured value stagnates or oscillates without a tendency. However, between 1.0m and 3.5m, the measured values seem to be meaningful.

median, and quantiles. The average value appears however as
less suitable, since only small packet quantities are regarded
and, thus, arising peaks could distort the result. Therefore, we
used only the minimum, the median, and the 25% quantile.
If we want to describe the measured RSSI values functionally, we need an illustration, which represents as exactly as possible the distances for measured RSSI values. For this function
the statistic data of the RSSI form the input and the associated
distance the output. In our experiments, we recognized that the
data can be best described by a linear or exponential function
as shown in Fig 12.

node was always the same. Since a localization procedure
needs data from many sensor nodes, which may stand in arbitrary alignment to the robot, we needed to examine whether the
change in the orientation of the sensor node changes the RSSI
values. It turned out that the standard deviation increased in
the case of rotation. During each measurement, the robot rotated 180° to the left then 360° to the right; finally it goes back
on the starting position. This rotation finally leads to a substantial advantage (Fig 10): using again the minimum of the RSSI
measures, it is possible to overcome orientation effects – while
the standard deviation of the measured values obviously increased. Thus, the experiment shows that a measurement without consideration of the orientation would be incomplete.

B. Estimation using artificial neural networks (ANNs)
ANNs are biologically inspired classification algorithms.
They try to simulate the human brain. Our brain consists of
about 10 billion neurons; each neuron connected to about
10,000 other neurons through dendrites (inputs) and axons
(output). At each neuron, the inputs are to be summed, if the
summation of the inputs is greater than a threshold, then the
neuron fires, and an output signal to the next neuron is generated. The inputs have different effects on the outputs depending on the synapse so some inputs have excitatory effects and
others have inhibitory effects. The strengths of the inputs is
determined by the weights in ANN. Feed forward artificial
neural networks perform signal processing without possible
feedback, thus, the signals flow from the inputs to the outputs
of the network through several layers of neurons.

V. DISTANCE APPROXIMATION
In order to approximate the distance between two nodes, we
compared two methods as discussed in the following.
A. Linear and exponential regression
The method for distance estimation is based on the comparison of the characteristics of descriptive data, e.g. the average,

In our experiments, seven nodes (BTnode2 … BTnode9)
are placed on the ground of our lab. We analyze the results of
the localization system for six different positions (A … F). We
tuned the system parameters to the values we tested in the past
experiments. The robot requests 60 packets from each node.

shold in the biological neural network. F() is called activation
function.
The weights are to be determined in the learning process.
This learning is either supervised or unsupervised. Samples
with inputs and outputs are needed in the supervised leaning,
while in the unsupervised are only the inputs needed. In this
paper, we used supervised learning to train the network to estimate the distance based on the RSSI values, so the inputs are
RSSI values and the output will be the estimated distance.
Back propagation is the common used learning method in feed
forward neural network. The error is to be back propagated to
adjust the weights to reduce the error between the actual output and the estimated output.
Our neural network is implemented using MATLAB. We
used an ANN with 60 inputs and one hidden layer with 20
neurons and one output. The sigmoid function is employed as
activation function for hidden layer and liner activation function for output layer. The weights and biases are optimized
using the Levenberg Marquardt optimization method.

VI. RSSI BASED LOCALIZATION
In this section, we show the applicability of the RSSI based
distance measurement for localization. The basic localization
method as used in our experiments is multilateration. Due to
the limited space, we only describe the basics of trilateration,
i.e. multilateration based on three measurements. Afterwards, a
number of experimental results are provided.
A. Trilateration
If we need to estimate the location of a node based on
known node, the position of this node is computed by the solution of a set of equations. The most common localization algorithm is the Trilateration as depicted in Fig 1.
If the distances are known to at least three reference objects,
one can set up a system of circle equations. Given the positions of three known anchor nodes Mi=(xi,yi), the following
equation system must be solved to get the search position
P=(ux,uy):
(ux - x1)2 + (uy - y1)2 = r12
(ux - x2)2 + (uy - y2)2 = r22
(ux - x3)2 + (uy - y3)2 = r32

curves. In particular, we evaluated linear and exponential regression using the minimum, the median, and the 20% quantile
of the measured RSSI values. The table shows the real and the
estimated distance to all sensor nodes. Additionally, the average estimation error is included in the table (last line). It is
clear from this table that median based with linear regression
has the smallest error compared to the other statistics and regression methods.

After training the artificial neural network using the data of
some calibration measures, the ANN was used to estimate the
distances to the anchor nodes similar to the regression techniques. The estimated distances for node A are shown in Table
III. Obviously, the estimation error of the ANN is comparable
to the statistical methods.

We finally used the multilateration technique to estimate the
location of the particular node in the environment. We tested
the impact of the number of anchor nodes for the quality of the
position approximation by using between four and seven anchor nodes for the multilateration process.
Fig 3 shows the location information for position A using 4,
5, 6, or 7 anchor nodes, respectively. As can be seen, the localization quality is quite high. Actually, position A represents a
typical example for the position quality. In the following, the
best and worst cases are described.

2) Worst case: position B
The position computation for position B is based on a maximum of six instead of seven distance estimations. The localization process is completely automated and it may occur that
any node is unavailable for the distance measurement process.
We did not correct this consciously, since in the reality the
occurrence of node failure is not rare. Table IV shows the distance estimation and Fig 4 depicts the corresponding average
localization. Obviously, the quality of the distance measurement is comparably bad in this example. The average distance
estimation error is about 0.8m resulting in high localization
errors. Interestingly, the distance estimation using the ANN
approach is much better in this example. Nevertheless, in average, both methods produce estimations with the same quality
and error range.

3) Best case: Position D
Position D supplies the best results despite high dispersion
over the averaged coordinates of all calculated positions. Table V shows the results for the distance estimations for position D. In this case, the regression method provides distance
estimations with an average error of less than 0.5m. This result
is quite encouraging compared to measures that can be found
in the literature. In this specific case, the ANN was not able to
produce high quality estimations as the average estimation
error was about 1m. We need to further study possible combinations of the statistical regression methods with “fuzzy” approaches such as the ANN.
Finally, Fig 5 depicts the localization quality for the best
case measurement, position D. Obviously, all the estimations
perfectly approximated the right position.

aged the position results over all possible combinations of distance information (similar to GPS) which did not improve the
results significantly.
The (well-known) major problem is that RSSI values do not
necessarily contain any distance information. However we
showed that even for noisy indoor environments an average
positioning error of 50cm on an area of 3.5 x 4.5 m is possible
by choosing the RF and algorithm parameters carefully based
on empirical studies.

VII. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, it can be said that a huge number of parameters must be considered for high quality distance estimation
and, therefore, localization in wireless sensor networks using
the received signal strength indicator. In particular, we identified the following parameters, which affected the distance
measurement to a certain degree:
• The used transmission power
• The radio frequency
• The node orientation, i.e. antenna characteristics
• The localization algorithm
• The quality of the reference measurements
Based on these findings, we developed an adaptive testbed
for distance measurements and localization experiments. In our
opinion the most important factor for proper distance estimation is to choose a transmission power according to the relevant distances. If the power is too high the RSSI differences
between different distances are not significant enough for a
good interpretation – if it is chosen too small far-field effects
take place for short distances already leading to calibration
data containing only little distance information.
It is also important to take care of the chosen frequency for
the localization setup. Our experiments have shown that some
frequencies are more vulnerable to disturbances than others.
But it can be assumed that this observation is individual for
different orientations and positions of the robot in the test setup. Therefore it is desirable to compare the measurements of
different frequencies not only prior but also during the localization to get the best possible results.
Depending on the quality of the antennas a RSSI based localization system must also take the bi-directional orientation of
sensor-nodes into account.
On the other hand we made the experience that the localization algorithm itself and the preparation and interpretation of
calibration data does not take much influence on the quality of
position estimation. In additional experiments we also aver-
