Location estimation is significant in mobile and ubiquitous computing systems. The complexity and smaller scale of the indoor
environment impose a great impact on location estimation. The key of location estimation lies in the representation and fusion of
uncertain information from multiple sources. The improvement of location estimation is a complicated and comprehensive issue.
A lot of research has been done to address this issue. However, existing research typically focuses on certain aspects of the problem
and specific methods. This paper reviews mainstream schemes on improving indoor location estimation from multiple levels and
perspectives by combining existing works and our own working experiences. Initially, we analyze the error sources of common
indoor localization techniques and provide a multilayered conceptual framework of improvement schemes for location estimation.
This is followed by a discussion of probabilistic methods for location estimation, including Bayes filters, Kalman filters, extended
Kalman filters, sigma-point Kalman filters, particle filters, and hidden Markov models. Then, we investigate the hybrid localization
methods, including multimodal fingerprinting, triangulation fusing multiple measurements, combination of wireless positioning
with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), and cooperative localization. Next, we focus on the location determination approaches that
fuse spatial contexts, namely, map matching, landmark fusion, and spatial model-aided methods. Finally, we present the directions
for future research.

1. Introduction
Location is the most fundamental and important context
in mobile and ubiquitous computing. A number of mobile
applications have the requirement on the location knowledge
of human or devices. It is estimated that people spend
about 87% of their time indoors [1]. Location-based services,
such as mobile social network [2] and Internet of Things
(IOTs) [3], are extending to indoor environments. In outdoor
environment, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
such as GPS can provide accurate location estimation, but
they almost do not work indoors [4]. To compensate the
drawback of GPS, some solutions have been proposed, such
as cellular-based positioning [5], but the accuracy achieved
is not high enough to meet the demand of most indoor
applications. Compared with open outdoor spaces, indoor

spaces are more complicated in terms of layout, topology,
and spatial constraints [6]. As a result, the wireless signal
suffers from multipath effect, scattering, and nonline of sight
propagating. Such effects cause extra signal attenuation and
propagation time, thereby reducing the localization accuracy
of these methods that assume wireless signal traverses in a
straight line and depend on the time traveled or the signal
strength received to estimate the location [7]. On the other
hand, due to the small-scale of the indoor environment, most
applications have high demand for accuracy, for example, 12 m or better. The accurate location determination remains
challenging for mobile indoor localization and inspires
researchers to constantly explore effective solutions.
Depending on whether there is a need for devices, indoor
positioning methods can be categorized into two types:
device-free and device-based [8]. The former is still in its

2
infancy and has a lot of limitations [9]. Because of this, the latter becomes the mainstream of indoor positioning and is also
the focus of this paper. Typical device-based location sensing
methods include proximity [10, 11], triangulation [5], fingerprinting [12], and dead reckoning [8, 13]. A proximity location
sensing technique implies determining when an object is
“near” a known location. There are three general approaches
to sense proximity: detecting physical contact, monitoring
wireless cellular access points (APs), and observing automatic
ID systems [10]. Triangulation is known as the ranging-based
method, which commonly uses Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UWB,
CSS, and RFID to obtain the measurements such as time
of arrival (TOA) [5, 10], angle of arrival (AOA) [5, 10],
symmetric double-sided two-way ranging (SDS-TWR) [14],
elapsed time between the two time of arrivals (ETOA) [15],
or received signal strength (RSS) [5, 10]. Based on these
measurements, the distances between the target and beacons
can be computed and then the location of the target can
be determined. Fingerprinting consists of two phases: offline
training and online location estimation. The offline phase
detects the signal strength from the surrounding beacons and
collects location fingerprints to create a fingerprint database.
In the online phase, the target obtains a vector of signal
strengths in real time. These signal measurements are then
compared with the fingerprints in the database. The location
of the best matched fingerprint is used as the estimated
location. Given the initial position, dead reckoning can in
real time infer the location of a mobile target equipped
with inertial measurement units (IMU) [13], for example,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, based on
the moving direction, velocity, and sampling interval.
Since the accuracy is the key indicator to evaluate the
performance of a localization system [4], much research has
put emphasis on how to improve the accuracy and provide
users with reliable, accurate localization services. The accuracy depends on many factors such as the accuracy of wireless
ranging, the algorithm used to deal with measurements,
and even the geometric layout of nodes [16]. The strategies
for enhancing accuracy typically focus on three directions
including optimizing hardware, improving location estimation, and enhancing the geometric dilution of precision
(GDOP) [16]. In fact, compared with the geometric factor,
the environments and hardware play a fundamental role
in the performance of indoor localization. Since hardware
optimization is inevitably restrained by their own coverage,
time resolution, and cost, much attention in this field is given
to the improvement approaches of location estimation [17–
22].
The process of localization contains measuring, location
update, and optional optimization [11, 23]. In the location
update stage, measurements are integrated into the positioning algorithm to compute the coordinates of a mobile
target [7]. The influence from noise, multipath, obstruction,
and hardware clock drift generates the uncertainty in the
raw measurements and signal metrics, such as distances,
thereby affecting the accuracy of location estimation. This
further results in that the achieved accuracy cannot meet
the need of most of applications and the optimization step
needs to be executed. In practice, the optimization begins

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
with the processing of measurements and persists throughout
the whole localization process. Therefore, the steps of location
update and optimization can be taken as one step, namely,
location estimation. The key of this step is to express the
uncertainty and to fuse multisource information [10].
Probabilistic techniques are effective tools to deal with
uncertainty problems. The most widely used one is the
Bayesian filtering. It can not only handle the uncertainty
problem but also fuse different measurements. The family
of Bayesian filtering includes Kalman filters [24], extended
Kalman filters [25], sigma-point Kalman filters [26], particle
filters [27], and hidden Markov models [28].
Each localization technique has its drawbacks when
comprehensively considering accuracy, cost, coverage, and
complexity. None of them can be suitable to all scenarios [4,
5, 10]. The probabilistic methods can reduce the uncertainty
of location estimation to some extent; it cannot eliminate
the drawback inherent in a technique. In this sense, the
improvement of accuracy using the probabilistic method is
still limited. On the other hand, the combination of multiple
techniques can complement each other and further improve
the accuracy. Such combinations include multimodal fingerprinting [29], triangulation fusing multiple measurements
[30], method combining wireless positioning with pedestrian
dead reckoning [31], and cooperative localization [23].
Fusing spatial contexts is another significant approach
for optimizing location estimation. An interesting phenomenon is that people usually complain that complex
indoor spaces make localization difficult and troublesome,
while the complexity can assist the positioning algorithm
to achieve higher accuracy. For instance, compared with
outdoor spaces, indoor spaces are closed; moving targets
cannot pass a wall; entering a room has to go through a
door. These characteristics of indoor spaces can be utilized
to improve the localization results [32]. Also, there are often
landmarks within an indoor environment, including visible
landmarks, such as stairs, elevators, and corners, and invisible
landmarks, such as magnetic outlier points. These landmarks
[21, 33] impose the sensors to present some predictable or
special patterns. By recognizing and analyzing these patterns,
the localization results can be refined. Combining the geometry, topology, and semantics of indoor spatial models with
Kalman filters or particle filters has been one of research
hotspots [10, 22, 34, 35].
The core of designing an indoor localization system
is determining the location estimation approaches. The
key of location estimation lies in the representation and
fusion of uncertain information from multiple sources. Many
approaches to enhance indoor localization results have been
proposed. However, existing research generally focuses on
certain aspects of the problem and specific methods. This
paper reviews typical schemes on improving indoor location
estimation from multiple levels and perspectives. By analyzing the error sources of typical localization approaches, we
present a multilayered conceptual framework for location
estimation refinement. Particularly, we discuss probabilistic technique-based approaches, hybrid location estimation
approaches, and localization approaches that fuse spatial
contexts. The basic rationales, state of the art, and advantages

and disadvantages of these methods, as well as potential
combination among them, are given. This can help people not only comprehensively understand the improvement
approaches of location estimation but also select the most
effective solution when designing a localization system.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces
the concept of location accuracy and precision, error sources
of typical localization approaches. In Section 3, we present a
multilayered conceptual framework for location estimation
enhancement. Section 4 gives the mathematical foundation
of location estimation, that is, probabilistic techniques,
including Kalman filters, extended Kalman filters, sigmapoint Kalman filters, particle filters, and hidden Markov
models. The application of Bayesian methods in different levels is also explored. In Section 5, hybrid location
estimation methods are investigated, including multimodal
fingerprinting, triangulation fusing multiple measurements,
combination of wireless positioning with pedestrian dead
reckoning, and cooperative localization. The location estimation improvement methods by fusing spatial contexts are
provided in Section 6, namely, map matching-aided methods,
landmark-aided methods, and spatial model-aided methods.
In Section 7, we discuss the open issues and comment on
possible future research directions. Finally in Section 8, a
conclusion is drawn.

2. Localization Accuracy Evaluation
Accuracy is one of the most significant indicators of localization performance. It is influenced by a lot of factors
such as environment noise, hardware error, and positioning
algorithms. This section begins with the comparison of
accuracy and precision. Then an analysis of the error sources
of typical localization approaches is presented. Finally, a multilayered framework for localization accuracy improvement is
proposed.
2.1. Accuracy and Precision. Accuracy and precision are
usually regarded as the same concept, but they actually
measure different aspects. Accuracy refers to the closeness
degree between the truth and the measurement or how
approximate the observation is to the truth [36], which
is typically expressed as a distance interval such as 1–3 m.
Precision represents the repeatability of measurements or
how often we can expect to get a certain degree of accuracy.
For the sake of simplicity, the accuracy and precision are
generally combined into one concept and simply called the
“accuracy” which is denoted by a distance interval.
2.1.1. Accuracy. Accuracy is the most vital indicator evaluating the performance of a positioning system, which is
defined with the average Euclidean distance between the true
location and the estimated location, also known as location
error [5]. In general, the location error can be expressed using
standard error, mean error, or median error. It is difficult
to precisely give the accuracy in most cases since there are
many factors affecting the accuracy. This means that even
the same system can show significantly varying accuracy

under different contexts. To better describe accuracy, the
distance interval is adopted, for example, 2-3 m. Accuracy
can be regarded as a potential bias or offset of a system.
Generally, the higher the accuracy, the better the system.
Nonetheless, the excessive pursuit of accuracy often results
in the degradation of other aspects of performance (e.g.,
real time, complexity, and cost). Therefore, when choosing a
system or technology, we need to take into account not only
accuracy but also other performance characteristics in the
light of the requirements.
2.1.2. Precision. Precision measures the consistency of a
system working under a level of accuracy. For instance,
it can measure how robust the system is since it reveals
the performance variation over many trials. The cumulative
probability function (CDF) is usually adopted to measure
precision [5] and is represented by the percentile format.
When we compare two systems, the system with the CDF
rising faster is considered to be the better one if they have
similar accuracy. For instance, suppose that there are two
localization systems: one with a precision of 70% within 1
meter (the CDF of distance error of 1 m is 0.7) and 95% with
2.5 m and the other with a precision of 55% within 1 m and
95% within 2.2 m as shown in Figure 1. The latter is commonly
considered as the one with higher performance.
2.2. Sources of Localization Error. Location error is inevitable
for any indoor positioning systems. The error can be divided
into three types: intrinsic error, extrinsic error, and algorithmic error [37]. Intrinsic error is caused by the limitation of
either hardware or software. Extrinsic error stems from environmental factors such as multipath and shadowing, multiple
access interference, fluctuations in the signal propagation
speed, and the presence of obstructions. Algorithmic error is
determined by the rationale of the designed positioning algorithm. Having a sound understanding to the error sources is
necessary to design a suitable solution.
2.2.1. Triangulation. The triangulation technique computes
the location of a target by using the distances or angles

between the target and beacons. The distances are usually
deduced from TOA, TDOA, ETOA, SDS-TWR, RSS, and so
on. Such time-based ranging methods have high requirement
on the hardware. For example, TOA and TDOA need the time
synchronization between targets and beacons. An error of
1 ns in the temporal domain can cause an error of 0.3 m in
the spatial domain. For those methods that do not need time
synchronization, such as SDS-TWR and ETOA, the most
important factor influencing accuracy is the processing of
the delay between the sender and the receiver. Because of
time-varying characteristics and low recognition rate, RSSbased methods commonly suffer from high location error.
Compared with TDOA, AOA-based methods demand special
hardware equipment, for example, directional antennas or
antenna arrays installed at the beacons [7]. AOA-based
methods also cost more for deployment and maintenance.
Moreover, the estimation using AOA is inaccurate when the
target is far from the beacons [5, 14]. Table 1 shows accuracy
comparisons of typical triangulation techniques.
Wireless signal is susceptible to reflection, refraction, and
diffraction of objects in the space of interest. As a result,
the signal traverse in multipath is the main contributor to
the location error for time-based ranging methods [38]. The
signal strength received from the direct path is also related to
the ranging error. When the strength is below a threshold, the
signal from the direct path would be omitted and the signal
from indirect paths with stronger strength would be chosen to
compute ranging result. This is called undetected direct path
and leads to large ranging error. Multipath, multiple access
interference, and obstructions also affect the performance
of RSS-based methods. The general solution is building an
approximate model that well describes the environment. Such
a model usually needs to consider the size, texture, and
thickness of obstructions in the environment.
Except the accuracy of the ranging measurements, geometric factors related to the relative location of the beacons
and the mobile devices also have a significant influence
on the accuracy of the triangulation localization technique
[7, 36]. If the location is geometrically calculated using the
triangulation algorithm, the location error will be further
magnified by dilution of precision (DOP). The general
form of DOP is geometric DOP (GDOP), which represents the magnification factor of the distances between the
target and the beacons. It explains how location accuracy
reduces with the effect of geometry. The volume of the
shape formed by the unit-vectors from the target to the
beacons is inversely proportional to the GDOP. A higher
GDOP implies more uncertainty in the calculated location

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
and hence the lower location accuracy. To minimize the
GDOP, we should always distribute beacons as evenly as
possible.
The research of GDOP focuses on optimizing the deployment manners or number of devices of localization system.
But this paper aims to explore the effective strategies and
algorithms of location estimation to particularly improve
localization accuracy. The discussion about GDOP is not in
the scope of this paper. Readers who are interested in GDOP
are recommended to see [16].
2.2.2. Fingerprinting. Indoor fingerprinting can use existing
signal sources to compute the location of a target. Because of
this, it has been a popular approach for indoor positioning.
Typically, signal sources include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GSM,
FM, DTV [29, 39, 40], terrestrial magnetism [41], lights,
and acoustic sources [2, 42]. An ideal signal source should
possess two properties: recognizability and stability. The
time-varying characteristic is the most significant factor to
affect the performance of fingerprinting. In other words,
it is difficult to match the online signal fingerprints with
these fingerprints collected and stored in the database in the
offline phase if the signal changes over time. The mismatch
can lead to a large location error and even cause failure to
positioning.
Besides, sensors of different brands have different specifications and varying sensor readings even at the same
locations [43]. That is, if we use smartphones of a brand to
collect training fingerprints and another brand’s smartphones
to receive online fingerprints, there would be a mismatch
between training fingerprints and online fingerprints. Both
the time-varying characteristic of the signal and the RSS
difference between sensors of different brands are illustrated
in Figure 2. The data for Figure 2 was collected at the
same point using a smartphone of brand A and another
smartphone of brand B during one hour. It shows that Wi-Fi
RSS presents the normal distribution and fluctuates around
a mean value. Figure 2 also demonstrates that there is a
significant difference in the RSS collected from different
smartphones.
To illustrate the time-varying characteristic of the magnetic signal and the effect of different devices, we collected
magnetic strength at a region with an area of 2 m × 14 m.
The magnetic distribution was calculated by interpolating.
Figure 3 shows how different two groups of data collected
at the same region during two different time periods
are. Similarly, there is a difference between data collected
by different smartphones at the same time, as shown in
Figure 4.
2.2.3. PDR. PDR [44] is a localization solution of pedestrian
equipped with IMU sensors given the initial position. It
is likely to play an increasingly significant role in indoor
tracking and navigation, due to its low cost and ability to work
without any additional infrastructure. This is especially useful
in the blind or weak area of wireless signal. In general, PDR
can be divided into three steps: step event capturing, stride
length calculation, and heading evaluation. The mathematical

On the other hand, the problem that PDR suffers from is
the cumulative error [45]. Because the location estimation is

always computed based on the prior result, the error accumulates rapidly over time. This means that the recalibration
is needed regularly in PDR. The accelerometer embedded
in a smartphone can be used to capture step events and to
further compute stride length using stride models such as
Weinberg. But it is susceptible to walking speed, road slope,
and so on [46], giving rise to the inaccurate results of stride
length computation.
Comparatively, the error from heading detection has
a greater influence on the location estimation than that

from stride length calculation [47]. The readings from both
magnetometers and gyroscopes can be utilized to compute
the heading. However, the magnetometer is prone to the
disturbance of electric current and metals in the environment; the gyroscope has the drift problem, which means that
the reading error rises over time. In addition, the tilt of the
smartphone can cause its heading to deviate from the user
walking direction [48]. The poses of the smartphones also
contribute to the accuracy of heading evaluation, which need
to be taken into account in practice.

3. Conceptual Framework of Improvement
Schemes for Location Estimation
The location error is unavoidable no matter which localization approach is used. To reduce the errors from different
sources, a number of solutions for improving location estimation have been proposed. However, most of the existing
research works generally concentrate on certain aspects
of the problem and specific methods. Here we provide a
comprehensive framework to introduce potential strategies

for location estimation enhancement, as shown in Figure 5.
The bottom layer is positioning hardware, including wireless
modules (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and UWB) and motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses). For a
particular localization technique, Bayesian filtering such as
particle filters, Kalman filters, and hidden Markov models can
be utilized to filter out the noise from measurements. There
are usually three options for filtering: raw measurements,
signal metrics (e.g., distances), and coordinates. Also, as a
mathematical tool, Bayesian filtering can be applied to fusion
of multiple localization techniques and fusion of spatial
contexts.
Except employing filtering technique to control the
location error of single localization approach, researchers
have put forward a series of hybrid localization approaches.
Through fusing different measurements and/or localization
techniques, it is possible to draw on each other’s strength
and to achieve an ideal accuracy. The fingerprinting error
stems mainly from low recognition rate of fingerprints, which
can be solved by adding the dimension of fingerprints,
that is, multimodal fingerprints. In this way, the reliability
as well as location accuracy can be improved significantly.
The main problem of PDR is that its cumulative error
increases over time. Combining PDR with geometric localization techniques such as UWB TDOA can eliminate the

cumulative error and achieve a higher location accuracy.
Typically, the results of geometric localization system are
used to calibrate the results of PDR. On the other hand,
the results of PDR can be used to eliminate the incidental
error of geometric localization system. For triangulation, the
error sources are mainly multipath, reflection, diffraction of
the signal, and nonline of sight environment. Multimodal
localization approaches can combine different techniques or
measurements (e.g., RSS, TOA, and TDOA) to determine the
location. When a positioning technique offers poor accuracy,
another one with better performance can be chosen. For
example, AOA can be used to relieve the effect of multipath
and nonline of sight (NLOS) to obtain higher accuracy.
Different from approaches above, cooperative localization
is able to use the distances, neighbour relationships, and
other spatial information between mobile targets to improve
location estimation. Cooperative localization technique can
also be combined with multimodal fingerprinting, which
can significantly reduce the probability of mismatch between
fingerprints and further obtain better location accuracy.
Indoor localization systems are considered to be one
of core components of mobile and ubiquitous computing
environment. In such localization systems, both Bayesian
filtering-based approaches and multimodal localization
approaches utilize mainly the measurements from wireless

network nodes and sensors. These measurements are often
regarded as the low-level context from the view of context
aware system. Besides, there are other higher level spatial
contexts [34] such as indoor maps, landmarks [21], and
spatial model [35]. These contexts can be used to restrain the
motion of a target and to eliminate the outliers of location
estimation, thereby optimizing location estimation. Recently,
fusion with spatial contexts has been an important method
for location estimation enhancement.
If the devices have enough computation resource, we can
further fuse multimodal fingerprinting with PDR and even
map matching to obtain an ideal accuracy. However, the more
the information is fused, the higher the algorithmic complexity as well as the cost is. Higher accuracy would reduce
the real time capability. When choosing a location estimation
scheme, there is often a need of “trade-off ” between accuracy
and other factors (e.g., effort, applicability, complexity, and
cost). Table 2 demonstrates the performance comparison of
different approaches to improve location estimation.

4. Probabilistic Methods for
Location Estimation
As mentioned in Section 2, the noise in measurements is
inevitable due to complicated indoor environments and other
factors, causing the uncertainty of location information.
Bayesian filtering estimates the states of a dynamic system
via probabilistic technique, which is suitable to deal with the
uncertainty problem caused by the measurement noise. It can
be also applied to fusion of multiple sensors or measurements
to achieve higher accuracy. This section begins with the
commonly used Bayesian filtering approaches, including
Kalman filers, extended Kalman filters, sigma-point Kalman
filters, particle filters, and hidden Markov models. Then, a
special example is provided to illustrate how to use these
filters to filter out the measurement noise so as to improve
location accuracy.
Except Bayesian filtering approaches, smoothing [18] is
another widely applied technology to process noise. It simply
computes the average value of measurements or estimates
within a sliding window. There are two types of smoothing
technology: time smoothing and space smoothing. Since

smoothing approach is simple and easy to implement, this
paper will not discuss it in depth.
4.1. Bayes Filters. Bayes filters are powerful probabilistic
tools that probabilistically estimate a dynamic system’s state
from noisy measurements [36]. In the context of positioning
applications, the state can be measurements of different levels
such as RSSs, distances, angles, and coordinates. Deduced
from Bayesian rules, Bayes filters use new observations to
calibrate probabilistic distribution [49]. The basic Bayesian
rules can be interpreted as follows:
𝑝 (𝑥 | 𝑜) =

𝑝 (𝑜 | 𝑥) 𝑝 (𝑥)
,
𝑝 (𝑜)

(2)

where 𝑝(𝑥) represent the prior probability of 𝑥, which is
known previous to new evidence 𝑜 being available. 𝑝(𝑜 |
𝑥)/𝑝(𝑜) indicates the effect of 𝑜 on the belief of 𝑥 and 𝑝(𝑥 |
𝑜) is posterior probability. Bayes filters aim to sequentially
estimate such beliefs over the state space conditioned on all
information included in the sensor data.
Assume that the state at time 𝑘 is represented by random
variable 𝑥𝑘 and the sensor data consists of a sequence of
observations 𝑜1 , 𝑜2 , . . . , 𝑜𝑘 . The uncertainty at each time step
is expressed as a probability distribution over 𝑥𝑘 , called
belief, Bel(𝑥𝑘 ). The belief Bel(𝑥𝑘 ) is defined as Bel(𝑥𝑘 ) =
𝑝(𝑥𝑘 | 𝑜1 , 𝑜2 , . . . , 𝑜𝑘 ). It means the probability of a target at
state 𝑥𝑘 given a sequence of observations 𝑜1 , 𝑜2 , . . . , 𝑜𝑘 . To
avoid the fact that the computation grows exponentially over
time, Bayes filters assume the system is Markov, meaning
that the current state 𝑥𝑘 includes all relevant information.
In other words, the current state 𝑥𝑘 depends only on the
prior state 𝑥𝑘−1 and the states before 𝑥𝑘−1 offer no additional
information. This assumption allows us to work out the belief
without losing information. Bayes filters use the following
equation to predict the state whenever a new observation 𝑜𝑘
is reported [36],
Bel− (𝑥𝑘 ) = ∫ 𝑝 (𝑥𝑘 | 𝑥𝑘−1 ) Bel (𝑥𝑘−1 ) 𝑑𝑥𝑘−1 ,

(3)

and then correct the predicted estimate using the new
observation 𝑜𝑘 [36],
Bel (𝑥𝑘 ) ←󳨀 𝛼𝑘 𝑝 (𝑜𝑘 | 𝑥𝑘 ) Bel− (𝑥𝑘 ) .

Bayes filters are an abstract concept and only provide a
framework that uses probabilistic technique to recursively
estimate the state. The implementation of Bayes filters needs
to specify both the state model and the measurement model.
Except processing the uncertainty of measurements, it can
also be used to fuse different measurements. Section 5 will
involve how to use Bayes filter-based methods to combine
different positioning technologies and measurements.
Next, we will introduce the basic ideas of Kalman filters,
extended Kalman filters, sigma-point Kalman filters, particle
filters, and hidden Markov models. An example based on WiFi positioning technique is given to illustrate that Bayes filterbased methods can be used in different levels to improve the
location accuracy.
4.2. Kalman Filters. The Kalman filters [25] are the most
frequently used variant of Bayes filters that pursue the optimal
state estimation based on the minimum-variance principle.
They assume that the posterior density at every time step is
Gaussian and the state sequences are Markov. There are two
models that need to be used: state model and measurement
model. The state model describes how the state changes over
time while the measurement model represents the change
of the state with measurement noise. To better illustrate the
rationale of the Kalman filter, let 𝑥𝑘 and 𝑧𝑘 indicate the
sequences of the state and measurements, respectively. The
corresponding state model and measurement model are as
follows:
State model: 𝑥𝑘 = 𝐴 𝑘 𝑥𝑘−1 + V𝑘 ,
Measurement model: 𝑧𝑘 = 𝐻𝑘 𝑥𝑘 + 𝑛𝑘 ,

(5)

(d) Updating the target’s state using measurements and
Kalman gain:
𝑥̂𝑘 = 𝑥̂𝑘− + 𝐾𝑘 (𝑧𝑘 − 𝐻𝑥̂𝑘− ) .

(9)

(e) Updating the error variance matrix using Kalman
gain:
𝑃𝑘 = (𝐼 − 𝐾𝑘 𝐻) 𝑃𝑘− .

(10)

Among the equations above, 𝑥 and 𝑧 are the target’s state
and measurements, respectively. 𝐾 is the Kalman gain, 𝐼 is the
identity matrix, and 𝑃 is the error covariance.
Markoulidakis et al. [50] used Kalman filters to optimize
the performance of Wi-Fi positioning system. Three different
options were considered: filtering of the sequences of RSS
measurements, filtering of the distances between the target
and beacons, and filtering of coordinates of the targets. It
turned out that filtering of RSS measurements outperformed
the two other options and especially the performance of
filtering of coordinates was the worst. Also, Kalman filters can
be used to deal with the heading evaluation of DR [47], which
can combine readings from the gyroscope with readings of
the compass. In this way, the drift problem of the gyroscope
and the influence of metals on the compass can be eliminated,
thereby achieving a more accurate heading evaluation.
Kalman filters are the optimal solution to the positioning
and tracking problem if its assumptions hold. It has been
widely applied to robot navigation, control, computer image
processing, and tracking. However, the posterior density is
not necessarily Gaussian and in this case it does not work very
well.

where 𝐴 𝑘 and 𝐻𝑘 are known linear functions, respectively,
and V𝑘 and 𝑛𝑘 are process noise and measurement noise. Both
V𝑘 and 𝑛𝑘 are assumed to be zero-mean Gaussian distributed
with known covariance 𝑄 and 𝑅, respectively.
The Kalman filter consists of two stages: prediction and
update. In the prediction phase, the current state and process
noise variance matrix are used to compute the prior estimate
of next state; in the update phase, new observations can
be employed to optimize the prior estimate obtained in the
prediction phase to gain improved posterior estimation. The
Kalman filter proceeds recursively in the order “predictingmeasuring-updating.”
The detailed calculation steps of Kalman filters are as
follows:

4.3. Extended Kalman Filters. Different from Kalman filters,
which can only deal with linear problems, the extended
Kalman filter (EKF) is able to process nonlinear problems by
using the first term in a Taylor expansion of the nonlinear
function. A higher order EKF would keep further terms in
the Taylor expansion, but this is at the expense of additional
complexity, thereby restraining its applicability.
The steps of EKF are described as follows:

(a) Utilizing the current state to predict the next state
with the assumption that the state model has no
influence from the noise:

(c) Computing the Kalman gain that minimizes the error
covariance matrix:

𝑥̂𝑘−

(18)

The EKF is originally used in the field of robot positioning
and tracking [25]. For instance, Jetto et al. [51] proposed an
adaptive EKF for the localization of mobile robots. Recently,
Yim et al. [52] developed an EKF-based Wi-Fi positioning
approach, which took the distances between the mobile target
and wireless APs as inputs. In this way, a more reasonable
state model was designed according to user motion characteristics and a better accuracy was achieved. Frank et al. [53]
utilized a two-layer EKF in which the bottom EKF was used
to process the data of inertial sensors and the upper EKF was
adopted to combine the output from the bottom EKF with
Wi-Fi positioning results.
The EKF can deal with many nonlinear and non-Gaussian
problems, and it has been widely used in many fields.
However, The EKF often approximates the probability density
function (PDF) of the observed signal as Gaussian distribution and does not consider the potential random variables
in the process of the state linearization. Instead, it only
employs the first-order term of the Taylor expansion of the
nonlinear function. Therefore, if the density is bimodal or
heavily skewed whereas Gaussian can never describe it well,
the EKF would fail to obtain the ideal performance [54].

4.4. Sigma-Point Kalman Filters. Unlike EKF, the sigmapoint Kalman filter (SPKF) [26] introduces unscented transform into the framework of EKF, which considers a set
of points selected from the Gaussian approximation to the
density, called sigma points. These points all are transmitted
via the true nonlinearity and are able to capture the true mean
and covariance of the Gaussian random variable. The SPKF is
considered to be an alternative solution to the EKF since it
can better deal with nonlinear/non-Gaussian problems. The
variants of the SPKF include unscented Kalman filters (UKF)
[55] and central difference Kalman filters (CDKF) [56].
To better describe the SPKF, the weighted statistical linear
regression (WSLR) is utilized to rewrite the target’s state
model and measurement model; namely,
𝑥𝑘 = 𝐴 𝑓,𝑘−1 𝑥𝑘−1 + 𝑏𝑓,𝑘−1 + 𝐺𝑓,𝑘−1 (V𝑘−1 + 𝜀𝑓,𝑘−1 ) ,

In the equations above, 𝜆 and 𝑤 denote scalar weights,
respectively, and 𝐿 is the dimension of the enhanced state.
The SPKF has been successfully applied to the positioning and
tracking field. For example, Paul and Wan [56] used it to fuse
a dynamic model of human walking with a lot of low-cost
sensor readings to track 2D position and velocity; Crassidis
[55] employed it to combine GPS measurements with inertial
measurements from gyroscopes and accelerometers to compute both the position and the attitude of a moving vehicle.
The algorithmic complexity of the SPKF is similar to
that of the EKF, but it can accurately capture the posterior
mean and covariance to the second order for any nonlinearity.
Although it overcomes the drawbacks of the EKF, it is
sensitive to the initial value. A small error in the initial value
can be amplified in the process of propagation and result
in a large error in the results. To relieve the effect of initial
error, the variance inflation principle can be adopted. Besides,
sampling strategies and sampling rate have an influence on
the performance of the SPKF [57].
4.5. Particle Filters. Particle filters [27] are numerical methods for approximating the solution of the filtering problem
based on Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo sampling.
The basic idea behind particle filters is to look for a set of
samples approximating the posterior probability density and
to replace the integral operation with the sample value to
estimate the ultimate state. Its calculation procedures can be
interpreted as follows:
(a) Initialization: draw a set of particles {𝑥0𝑖 }𝑁
𝑖=1 according
to the initial probabilistic density 𝑝(𝑥0 ) and set the
weight for each particle to 1/𝑁.
(b) Sampling: draw {𝑥𝑘𝑖 }𝑁
𝑖=1 according to the density function:
𝑁

{𝑥𝑘𝑖 }𝑖=1 ∼ 𝑞 (𝑥𝑘 | 𝑥0:𝑘−1 , 𝑧𝑘 ) .

(23)

(c) Weight computation: the weight of each particle is
updated as
𝑖
𝑤𝑘𝑖 = 𝑤𝑘−1

𝑖
𝑝 (𝑧𝑘 | 𝑥𝑘𝑖 ) 𝑝 (𝑥𝑘𝑖 | 𝑥𝑘−1
)
𝑖
𝑞 (𝑥𝑘𝑖 | 𝑥𝑘−1
, 𝑧1:𝑘 )

.

(24)

Normalizing the weights,
𝑤𝑘𝑖󸀠 =

𝑤𝑘𝑖

𝑗

∑𝑁
𝑗=1 𝑤𝑘

.

(25)

(d) State estimate: the probabilistic distribution 𝑝(𝑥𝑘 |
𝑧1:𝑘 ) after filtering can be approximated as
𝑁

󸀠

𝑝 (𝑥𝑘 | 𝑧1:𝑘 ) ≈ ∑𝑤𝑘𝑖 𝛿 (𝑥𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘𝑖 ) ;

(26)

𝑖=1

thus, the ultimate state can be written as
𝑁

𝑥𝑘󸀠 = ∑𝑤𝑘𝑖󸀠 𝑥𝑘𝑖 .
𝑖=1

(27)

(e) Resampling: a common problem encountered by the
particle filter is the degeneracy phenomenon; that is,
all but one particle will have negligible weight after
a few iterations. Resampling is an effective method
to address this problem, which usually eliminates
particles with small weights and concentrates on
particles with large weights. There are many resampling strategies [58, 59] such as stratified resampling,
residual resampling, and systematic resampling.
There are a number of variants of particle filters such
as auxiliary particle filters [60], regularized particle filters
[61], adaptive particle filters, and local linearization particle
filters. Particle filters have been widely used in outdoor or
indoor positioning, navigation, and tracking. For instance,
Gustafsson et al. [62] developed a particle filter-based framework that integrated map matching, GPS, and cellular technologies, which could be applied to navigation, tracking, and
anticollision of cars as well as aircrafts. Evennou and Marx
[31] developed a structure that consisted of a Kalman filter
and a particle filter to combine pedestrian dead reckoning
and Wi-Fi signal strength measurements. The Kalman filter
provided real time position and inferred position when
a user was in the wireless blind areas, while the particle
filter was used to correct the drift on the inertial sensors
[63–65]. As one of the most promising filters for indoor
location estimation, the key advantage of particle filters is the
capability to describe arbitrary probability densities and they
have been widely accepted [4, 8, 10, 13, 17, 19, 22, 27, 66–72].
Particularly, they are suitable for processing non-Gaussian,
nonlinear problems and able to converge to the true posterior
if there are enough large samples, which is unfulfilled by
Kalman filters. However, the performance of them depends
strongly on the number of samples used for filtering. To
some extent, the more the samples, the higher the accuracy.
But this results in the rise of the computational complexity.
In the worst case, the complexity grows exponentially in
the dimensions of the state space [10]. In addition, there is
the degeneracy phenomenon after a few iterations, which
implies that we need to choose good importance density
or use resampling strategies. Overall, there is a need of
trade-off between the efficiency and the real time capability.
In particular, inappropriate methods may lead to the bad
performance.
4.6. Hidden Markov Models. The hidden Markov model
(HMM) [73] is developed based on the Markov model, in
which each state represents a physically observable symbol.
Compared with Markov models, which need each state to be
directly observed, HMM has no such restrictive requirement
and assumes that an observation is a probabilistic function
of hidden states. Due to the fact that physical states of many
applications are unobservable, HMM is more applicable than
traditional Markov models. A typical HMM is shown in
Figure 6 where we can see that there are five key components:
(a) 𝑆 = {𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , . . . , 𝑠𝑁}, a set of 𝑁 hidden states. The state
at time 𝑘 is denoted by 𝑠𝑘 .

(e) 𝜋 = {𝜋𝑖 }, the initial state distribution, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁.
Let 𝜆 = {𝐴, 𝐵, 𝜋} represent the parameters of a HMM
and 𝑂 = {𝑜1 , 𝑜2 , . . . , 𝑜𝑀} is a sequence of observations; there
are three basic problems: (i) evaluation problem: compute the
probability 𝑝(𝑂 | 𝜆), given the HMM and the observation
sequence; (ii) decoding problem: work out the most likely
sequence of hidden states that produced this observation
sequence, given the HMM and the observation sequence; (iii)
learning problem: how to adjust the model parameters 𝜆 to
maximize 𝑝(𝑂 | 𝜆).
In the context of location estimation, a hidden Markov
model describes the temporal correlation of a user’s positions. The state corresponds to location and the observation
depends only on the current position. Kontkanen et al. [74]
demonstrated the feasibility of HMM to track the target in
the areas of wireless radio networks. When the target was
moving at a normal speed, it was possible to observe a
series of continuous, dynamic measurements, upon which
the location estimation problem could be modelled into a
function of time. The location of a target at the current
time step only relied on that at the previous time step.
In this way, it significantly reduced the error of location
estimation when performing dynamic tracking. Wallbaum et
al. [75] used the HMM to improve the accuracy of Wi-Fi
positioning technology. In their research, Wi-Fi fingerprints
were considered as hidden states and RSS measurements as
observations. This was enhanced by [76, 77], who further
introduced PDR to accurately generate the state model.
Different from other researches, Park et al. [28] took the
reference points of Wi-Fi fingerprints as the state of HMM
and eliminated a large part of location error.

In comparison with other Bayesian filtering techniques,
the HMM has its special advantages. It is more suitable
for the fusion of different types of measurements and/or
localization approaches. This is because Kalman filters or
extended Kalman filters have the Gaussian assumption,
which conflicts with some positioning measurements [77].
Also, the efficiency of HMM is higher than particle filter
which requires high computation resources. In particular,
without any restrictions on the motion of the target, the
HMM is more applicable to represent the complex motion of
indoor targets [77].
4.7. Applications of Bayesian Location Estimation. Bayesian
filtering is an effective tool to process the measurement
noise as well as fuse different types of measurement or
localization techniques. It has been demonstrated that the
measurement noise can be processed in different levels [50],
such as RSS, distances, and coordinates, as shown in Figure 7.
This subsection provides a filtering framework for location
estimation, which does not rely on a particular filter.
Let 𝑋𝑘 represent the state of the target at time step 𝑘 and
𝑍𝑘 is the corresponding observation. Thus, the state model
and measurement model can be written as follows.
State model
𝑋𝑘 = 𝐴𝑋𝑘−1 + Γ𝑊𝑘 .

(30)

Measurement model
𝑍𝑘 = 𝐻𝑋𝑘 + 𝑈𝑘 ,

(31)

where 𝐴 and 𝐻 denote the state transition matrix and
measurement matrix, respectively. 𝑊 and 𝑈 are zero-mean
Gaussian random variables.
Taking Wi-Fi positioning technique as an example, we
introduce how to use the filter in different levels and to
describe the corresponding models. In the process of Wi-Fi
fingerprint positioning, the RSS measurements between the
target and the beacons are collected at first; then compute the
distances between the target and the beacons using typical
RSS-distance model or curve fitting; finally, the coordinates
of the target can be calculated via trilateration or multilateration. The state models and measurement models for three
filters (RSS filter, distance filter, and coordinate filter) are
presented in the following.
(1) RSS-Based Filter. For RSS filter, the state vector and
observation at time 𝑘 are written as

5. Hybrid Methods for Location Estimation
As analyzed in Section 2.2, each type of measurement has
its own inherent error characteristics, which means that the
accuracy improvement of one single technique is always limited. Comprehensively, considering the cost, infrastructure,
mobile device, and accuracy of localization systems, none of
the techniques and algorithms can fulfill the requirements of
all the applications.
On the other hand, with the development of mobile
communication technologies, wireless infrastructures are
increasingly available in indoor environments, and many
different types of smart mobile devices and sensors are
becoming ubiquitous. This leads to the constant emerging
of novel applications, such as mobile social networks. In
this case, it is highly likely that there exist different types
of wireless networks or signals in the same environment.
For example, a factory would use UWB networks for the
location-based service while Wi-Fi networks for the Internet
connection service. Besides, modern mobile devices are
equipped with wireless modules (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth)
and sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses,
and barometers). This has strongly driven the development
of hybrid localization techniques combining heterogeneous
measurements and approaches. The hybrid methods can
exploit their positive aspects and limit the impact of their
negative aspects and hence significantly improve the location
estimation.
This section reviews some major hybrid localization
methods. In this paper, hybrid localization methods are
classified into four categories: multimodal fingerprinting,
triangulation fusing multiple measurements, the combining
wireless positioning with pedestrian dead reckoning, and
cooperative localization.
5.1. Multimodal Fingerprinting. A large number of indoor
localization techniques adopt fingerprint matching as the
basic scheme of location estimation. This process normally
consists of two stages: the offline training phase and the
online location estimation phase. The offline phase is also
called training phase, in which a radio map of the area in
study is built. Signal characteristics (e.g., RSS) from multiple
beacons are registered at reference points (RPs). The online
phase is also called localization phase, in which the mobile
devices collect signal characteristics in real time and estimate
its location through best matching between the signal metrics
being collected and those previously registered in the radio
map. Together with no special demands on infrastructures
and mobile devices, the characteristics of low cost and high
accuracy make fingerprinting a very popular localization
technique and well-studied.
As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, an ideal fingerprint signal
source should be recognizable and stable. The most popular fingerprint signal for indoor localization is Wi-Fi RSS.
Actually, other kinds of RSS measurements (e.g., Bluetooth,
FM, DTV, and GSM), magnetic strength, and even ambient
features (e.g., sound, light, and color) can also be considered
as fingerprints. One common solution for improving fingerprinting is to enhance the recognition rate of fingerprint

signals. Since fingerprint signals present a great difference
at distinct positions, extending the dimension of fingerprint
signals can dramatically improve the recognition rate. In this
section, the multimodal fingerprinting techniques fusing WiFi RSS with other fingerprint signals are described as follows.
5.1.1. Combining Wi-Fi with Magnetic Strength. Wi-Fi signal
has global recognizability, because the MAC address of every
AP is unique worldwide. However, due to the signal fluctuation, the local recognition rate of Wi-Fi RSS is normally low.
Wi-Fi RSS-based fingerprinting can only acquire an accuracy
of about 3 m. In contrast, magnetic strength has relatively
high local recognition rate. In particular, when there are
metals and electric devices around, magnetic fingerprinting
can achieve high localization accuracy. Angermann et al.
[78] drew a conclusion through detailed experiments that the
resolution of magnetic signal could reach centimeter-level
accuracy. However, it could not be recognized globally. The
fusion of Wi-Fi and geomagnetic signal can make up the
drawbacks of both sides, realizing fine-grained localization
accuracy globally [79]. Geomagnetic fingerprints have two
forms. One is the triple composed by magnetic strength
sensed from the three-axis magnetometer. The other is the
geomagnetic magnitude at a certain location. The former
considers the attitude of mobile devices when collecting
fingerprints, while the latter does not need to consider. This
is because no matter what the attitude of mobile devices is,
theoretically, the geomagnetic magnitude of a location does
not vary. The two forms can be given as follows:
𝑓𝑝1 = {(𝐴𝑃1 , RSS1 ) , {𝐴𝑃2 , RSS2 } , . . . , {𝐴𝑃𝑛 , RSS𝑛 } ,
mag 𝑥, mag 𝑦, mag 𝑧} ,
𝑓𝑝2 = {(𝐴𝑃1 , RSS1 ) , {𝐴𝑃2 , RSS2 } , . . . , {𝐴𝑃𝑛 , RSS𝑛 } ,

(37)

magnetic} ,
where (𝐴𝑃1 , RSS1 ) represents that the signal strength of 𝐴𝑃1 is
RSS1 and mag 𝑥, mag 𝑦, mag 𝑧 are magnetic strength sensed
from three axes of magnetometers, respectively. magnetic is
the geomagnetic magnitude.
5.1.2. Combining Wi-Fi with Other Opportunistic Signals.
Opportunistic signal here refers to these signals existing
in our environment, which are not specially created for
positioning purpose, such as FM, GSM, DTV, and Bluetooth.
There is no essential difference between Wi-Fi and these
opportunistic signals when they act as fingerprints. These
wireless signals are sent by globally unique beacons and then
received by mobile devices. During this process, the mobile
devices can extract some useful information, such as RSSs,
signal to noise ratio (SNR), multipath, and distances, which
all can be used to generate fingerprints [29]. Moreover, WiFi fingerprint database can be expanded through adding
its dimension using these opportunistic fingerprints. As a
result, the accuracy of location estimation can dramatically
be improved [29, 40, 80]. Figure 8 shows the architecture of

corresponding fingerprint form is given as follows:

where (𝐴𝑃1 , RSS1 ) represents that the signal strength of
Wi-Fi 𝐴𝑃1 is RSS1 . 𝐵𝑆𝑗 refers to Bluetooth beacon, and
measurement𝑗 denotes the corresponding measurement signal. Apart from the above mentioned opportunistic signals,
some ambience features such as light, color, and even background sound can also be utilized to enhance fingerprinting
[2, 42].
As an improvement scheme for location estimation,
multimodal fingerprinting has no special requirements for
infrastructures and just the need to collect available signals
from surrounding environments. Combining different types
of fingerprints together to generate multidimensional fingerprints can considerably improve the recognition rate of
fingerprints and therefore the localization accuracy. However,
the disadvantages of all the fingerprinting approaches are
that the training process for collecting fingerprints is laborintensive and time-consuming. Although researchers have
proposed many unsupervised techniques for training fingerprints, most of them highly depend on the availability of finegrained floor plans or initial positions of users. Therefore,
these solutions are not always ideal for many applications.
5.2. Triangulation Fusing Multiple Measurements. Triangulation uses geometric properties of the triangle formed by the
target device and the beacons to estimate location, and it can
fall into two categories: lateration and angulation. Lateration
measures the distances between mobile targets and multiple

beacons, which are used to estimate the position of mobile
targets. Therefore, lateration is also regarded as a ranging
technique. While angulation calculates the position through
measuring the angles between mobile targets and multiple
beacons [5].
The coexistence of heterogeneous networks in the environment enables users to simultaneously obtain various triangulation measurements. The most common signal metrics
of ranging approaches are RSS, TOA, TDOA, and Time
of Flight (TOF). In particular, RSS has become a standard
parameter of most wireless devices, and it can be easily
acquired through pervasive devices. For instance, nanoLoc
[14, 81] is able to obtain TOF and RSS at the same time.
However, under different wireless channels and network
conditions, TDOA, TOA, AOA, and RSS have different error
characteristics, and correspondingly different localization
algorithms will be adopted. In general, localization techniques based on one single measurement cannot reach a
satisfactory accuracy, particularly in NLOS environments
where positioning results tend to present a larger deviation.
Theoretically, hybrid localization techniques [36, 49, 82],
such as TOA and RSS [30, 83–85], TDOA and AOA [86,
87], RSS and AOA [88, 89], TOA and AOA [90–92], and
fusing multiple measurements can overcome the shortages
of localization technique with single measurement. There
are several typical measurement fusion models explored as
follows.
The most common fusion models of multiple measurements include least squares (LS) or weighted least squares
(WLS) [86, 89, 90], maximum likelihood (ML) [30, 88],
Bayes filters [87], and Taylor series [85]. Each model provides
different trade-offs between the positioning accuracy and
complexity. The general framework of multimodal triangulation is shown in Figure 9.

Fusion methods

Depending on the way of measurements fusion, multimodal triangulation can be divided into two basic categories:
fusion between distance measurements and fusion of distances and angle measurements. Because each category has
similar fusion methods, we just consider the fusion of TDOA
and AOA and the fusion of RSS and AOA as the examples.
Chan and Ho [93] proposed a widely used fusion algorithm
based on TDOA, which could achieve a great positioning
accuracy in the Gaussian noise environment. Particularly, the
fusion method of TDOA and AOA is based on Chan and Ho’s
algorithm. By adding an angle measurement error in the original TDOA error equations to form a 2D nonlinear equation
set, the estimated location of targets can be computed using
twice the least squares (LS) [86].
The fusion algorithm of RSS and TOA tends to combine
the distance metric obtained by using RSS and that acquired
by using TOA between mobile targets and beacons. In a
sense, this equals increasing the number of beacons in the
environment (i.e., RSS and TOA metrics extracted from
different beacons) or increasing the dimension of observation
values (i.e., RSS and TOA metrics derived from the same
beacon) [84]. The following is the specific fusion algorithm
of RSS and TOA by employing extended Kalman filter.
Suppose that there are 𝐿 UWB beacons and 𝑀 ZigBee
beacons in the environment and RSS is obtained from
ZigBee beacons, while TOA is obtained from UWB beacons.

The drawback of multimodal triangulation is that it relies
too much on positioning hardware. Although the fusion of
TDOA and AOA is theoretically feasible, wireless network
devices in real world that can support TDOA and AOA
measuring are rare. In particular, RSS, TOA, and TDOA
ranging and AOA measuring are easily affected by various
factors such as multipath and NLOS. It is, today, still difficult
to eliminate these effects. In general, when choosing two
or more techniques and/or measurements for fusion, there
should be at least one kind of techniques or measurements
which are not affected by multipath and NLOS. For example,
we usually combine triangulation with PDR [94, 95] or fingerprinting, because PDR and fingerprinting are less affected
by multipath and NLOS.

5.3. Hybrid Location Estimation by Fusing PDR. PDR is
a self-localization and navigation technique, which can be
realized on current mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and
tablets) equipped with IMU. From a known position, we
can infer users’ location at next step by detecting users’ step
events and estimating the length and heading of each step.
PDR is a relative localization approach, and current location
estimation depends on the prior estimation. Although each
estimation might have quite small error, the cumulative error
grows quickly over time, leading to the fact that PDR is not
suitable for long time tracking tasks. In contrast, each location

estimation from absolute localization techniques (e.g., Wi-Fi,
UWB, and magnetic fingerprinting) has nothing to do with
the previous positioning results. However, the localization
results of the absolute techniques during a short time may
dramatically jump for a variety of reasons mentioned above.
For example, two successive estimation results (e.g., in a 3 s
interval) may present a difference at ten or dozens of meters,
which is obviously impossible for normal people movements.
The combination of PDR and absolute localization techniques can complement each other. Therefore, it can reduce
the possibility of jumping estimations and obtain accurate
and reliable localization results even during a long time
tracking. Besides, it can work functionally even when mobile
targets walk into the blind area of wireless signal, for example,
tunnels, where other localization techniques almost do not
work.
The methods for fusing PDR and wireless localization
techniques are commonly based on Bayes techniques, such
as Kalman filters [96], particle filters [64], and the HMM
[76]. The measurements of PDR, including step length and
heading, are normally used to generate the motion model
in Bayes filter to predict targets’ location. The metrics such
as distance and location estimated from Wi-Fi and UWB
[66, 94, 96] act as the observations. The typical architecture of
PDR-based hybrid location estimation is shown in Figure 10.
Next, we give a detailed example of fusing PDR and WiFi fingerprinting with particle filter. The state vector of
𝑇
targets is denoted as 𝑋𝑘 = (𝑥𝑘 𝑦𝑘 𝜃𝑘 ) , consisting of their
coordinates and headings. The measurement model and state
model in particle filter are given as follows.

where 𝑠𝑘 is the step length at time 𝑘 which is calculated with

random process. Since the heading is filtered by a Kalman
filter, the orientation change 𝛿𝜃𝑘 can be obtained directly
from the Kalman filter.

measurement, respectively.

where 𝑋𝑥𝑘𝑖 is the location of the 𝑖th particle at time
𝑘 and 𝜎 is the confidence of measured location with
Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The smaller 𝜎 will be, the more
confident the user is at the measured location. The
weight of all particles is normalized with the following
equation:

as

󸀠

𝑝 (𝑥𝑘 | 𝑧1:𝑘 ) ≈ ∑ 𝑤𝑘𝑖 𝛿 (𝑥𝑘 − 𝑥𝑘𝑖 ) ;

𝑖=1

then, we are able to obtain the position estimation
with the following equation:
𝑁

𝑋𝑘󸀠 = ∑𝑤𝑘𝑖󸀠 𝑥𝑘𝑖 .

(54)

𝑖=1

The challenge for PDR-based hybrid location estimation
lies in the correct estimation of users’ movement heading,
because heading errors affect the PDR estimation the most.
As we have mentioned earlier, estimated heading is not always
coincident with users’ moving heading due to the tilt of
mobile devices, which is especially the case for smartphones.
Many research works assume that users hold the phones in
hands and keep the 𝑦-axis of phones coincident with users’
moving heading [96]. Actually, this assumption is very

demanding because users may place their phones in any
attitudes, such as holding them in hands, putting them in
pockets, or keeping them near the ear for calling. Also, it is
impossible for users to keep their phones in one single
attitude all the time, and the changes between different
attitudes may occur frequently. To address this problem, Rai
et al. [64] proposed a method through using the spatial
constraints to mitigate the negative effects caused by the tilt
of mobile devices. But it is not easy for the public to get such
a specific indoor floor plan. How to correctly estimate the
walking heading is the key problem the PDR-based fusion
solution is faced with.
5.4. Cooperative Location Estimation. Cooperation between
peer nodes, in wireless sensor networks, is used for improving
the performance and the coverage of networks. Recently,
cooperation technique is introduced to the navigation and
positioning field to improve the accuracy of traditional localization techniques [23, 67, 97]. Depending on the requirements for the infrastructure, the traditional indoor localization techniques fall into two basic types: infrastructure-based
(e.g., Wi-Fi, UWB, and ZigBee positioning systems) and
infrastructure-free (e.g., PDR) localization. The former needs
to deploy wireless beacons and depends on the measurements
between the mobile target and beacons to localize, such
as the signal strength, distances, and angles. Infrastructurefree localization is also called self-localization, in which the
mobile device collects the sensor data from the IMU sensors
embedded in it and estimates its location. However, both of
the two common localization techniques ignore the measurements between mobile targets. In cooperative localization,
mobile targets within the communication range can interact
with each other to obtain their spatial relations, for example,
proximity and distances. Such spatial information between
neighboring nodes can contribute to improve the localization
accuracy and robustness. Moreover, in infrastructure-based
localization, when mobile targets do not sense adequate
beacons (e.g., the number is less than 3), neighboring nodes
can be regarded as the alternatives of missing beacons and
thereby extend the coverage of localization system. As shown
in Figure 11, the traditional infrastructure-based localization
approach can only locate a limited number of mobile targets,
because other targets cannot receive measurements from
adequate enough beacons. In contrast, in cooperative localization, all the mobile targets can exchange measurements
with their neighboring nodes within the communication
range and then use these measurements to enhance location
estimation.
There are two basic parts in cooperative localization
systems: traditional localization and peer-to-peer communication. The cooperative localization problem can be represented as follows: estimating a parameter 𝑥 standing for the
locations of all mobile targets from an observation 𝑧. Here, 𝑧
denotes not only the measurements between mobile targets
and beacons but also that between mobile targets. Typically,
cooperative localization obtains the distance measurements
[97] among peers through a variety of signal metric techniques, such as RSS-based signal propagation model or

TDOA. Others would capture the social relationships (e.g.,
encountering) [20] between mobile targets to improve localization. In the cooperative localization system, the traditional
localization techniques could be self-localization [67, 98, 99]
or infrastructure-based localization (e.g., Wi-Fi APs-based
[100] and UWB beacons-based [101]).
We categorize cooperative localization as Bayesian or
non-Bayesian (deterministic) [23], depending on whether or
not we consider 𝑥 as a realization of a random variable.
5.4.1. Non-Bayesian Estimation. Non-Bayesian estimators
treat a target’s location as an unknown deterministic parameter, and it includes the least squares (LS) estimator and the
maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. The LS estimator
assumes 𝑧 = 𝑓(𝑥)+𝑛, where 𝑓(⋅) is a known function and 𝑛 is
the measurement error. The LS estimate of 𝑥 is obtained by
solving the following optimization problem:

The ML estimator considers the statistics of noise sources and
maximizes the likelihood function:

Raulefs et al. [102] proposed an UWB cooperative localization solution, in which particle filter was used to track
targets’ locations. Levy flight model was used to represent
the motion model of users and the initial position was
estimated with UWB beacons. During the tracking process,
the distances between mobile targets and beacons as well as
other peer nodes could be obtained and used to compute

the location of a mobile target through nonlinear weighted
least squares algorithm. The estimated location was then
treated as the observation of particle filter. Vaghefi and
Buehrer [103] put forward a long term evolution- (LTE-)
based cooperative localization solution. The targets could not
only receive observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA)
of the noncooperative signal from LTE beacons but also
interact with peer nodes to obtain round-trip time (RTT) of
the cooperative signal. Finally, ML was used to fuse the two
kinds of measurements to accurately calculate the location of
targets. Liu et al. [100] adopted the deterministic cooperative
localization method, in which acoustic ranging technique
was introduced to obtain the accurate distance among the
peer nodes. Also a distribution graph of mobile targets
was created. The distribution graph of mobile targets was
then matched with the distribution graph of fingerprints to
improve the localization accuracy. This algorithm representatively used the spatial constraints between mobile targets to
reduce the probability of erroneous fingerprint matching.
5.4.2. Bayesian Estimation. Bayesian estimation uses probabilistic techniques to compute targets’ locations, which treats
the location as a realization of a random variable 𝑥 with an a
priori distribution 𝑝𝑥 (𝑥). Bayesian estimation methods can
be generally divided into two types: the minimum mean
squared error (MMSE) estimator and the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimator. MMSE tries to minimize the
estimation error as follows:
󸀠
𝑥MMSE
= ∫ 𝑥𝑝𝑥|𝑧 (𝑥 | 𝑧) 𝑑𝑥.

distribution, and it can be treated as the regular ML
estimator:

Tseng et al. [67] proposed a self-localization-based cooperative scheme where the mobile target obtained the noncooperative measurements (TOA) between itself and beacons
and cooperative measurements (TOA) between itself and
peer nodes. Particle filter was used to track the mobile users
and these noncooperative and cooperative measurements
were treated as the input of the observation model. Strömbäck
et al. [104] achieved tracking of mobile targets through PDR
and the distance between mobile targets obtained by the
wearable UWB modules. These two kinds of signal metrics
were fused by the Kalman filter, and the the accuracy was
improved. Li et al. [105] proposed a similar PDR-based
cooperative localization approach, in which PDR was used
for self-tracking and acoustic ranging technique was used
to detect proximity. When the proximity of two mobile
targets was detected, which meant that their current locations
would be equal, the PDR tracking results of two targets then
were calibrated. It could eliminate the accumulative error
caused by tracking a single target with PDR. This process
was also implemented with the Kalman filter. Jun et al. [20]
implemented a cooperative localization solution from the
perspective of social sensing. By utilizing the encountering
and nonencountering events in social activities to constrain
users’ possible locations, the accuracy of existing localization
techniques such as Wi-Fi fingerprinting and PDR could be
enhanced. The encountering and nonencountering events
were detected with the built-in Wi-Fi modules. Finally, users’
location is estimated with probabilistic methods.
Cooperative localization techniques depend on the interaction and information exchange between mobile targets.
However, in the places with a high density of mobile targets,
such as airports, the communications between each pair of
mobile targets would bring great pressure to the network and
even give rise to network congestion. Moreover, this would
significantly increase the power consumption for mobile
targets. On the other hand, when determining the location
of each mobile target, cooperative localization algorithm
commonly needs to refer to spatial information between
current node and its neighboring nodes. More often, in order
to obtain better localization results, we need to take into
account the globally spatial distribution of all nodes. Thus, the
computational complexity of cooperative localization algorithm may be very high. In general, in order to measure the
spatial information between mobile targets, mobile devices
require the access to the physical processing units or the
additional functional modules. These requirements would
not be met in many applications. For instance, most of
commercial smartphones do not allow average users to access
some particular underlying hardware, such as the bottom
layer interfaces of acoustic sensors, which is necessary to
acquire the distance between two smartphones [15].

6. Location Estimation by Fusing
Spatial Contexts
Although hybrid localization can significantly improve location estimation, they have the particular demands for infrastructures and mobile devices, especially for sensors and
wireless protocols. In many cases, these requirements cannot
be met at all. Too much dependence on positioning hardware
would limit the use of hybrid schemes in many applications.
Thus, it is necessary to make use of the context information
derived from nonlocalization devices in order to improve the
location estimation. In fact, on the one hand, the complex and
constrained indoor spaces give rise to so much troubles for
localization. On the other hand, they also provide the rich
spatial contexts for enhancing localization results [34]. These
spatial contexts typically include the indoor structures (e.g.,
rooms, corridors, and stairs), facilities (e.g., desks, doors, and
elevators), and various landmarks (e.g., corners and signal
blind areas). In particular, they can be used to constrain
mobile targets’ movement and/or calibrate localization results
and, therefore, eliminate some erroneous estimation results.
Currently, fusion with spatial contexts has become an important method for improving location estimation.
6.1. Map Matching-Aided Estimation. Indoor maps, the main
carrier of spatial contexts and the foundation of indoor LBS
applications, are now widely used to aid indoor localization.
This process is also called map matching. Map matching
is first applied in the intelligent transport system (ITS), in
which the spatial road network is used to determine the
spatial reference of the vehicle’s location after the coarse
location is obtained from traditional positioning technologies
such as GPS or PDR. The main purpose of map matching
is to identify the correct road segment on which a vehicle
is traveling and to determine the vehicle location on that
segment [106]. The assumption of this algorithm especially is
that the vehicle is constrained to a finite network of roads.
Obviously, this is valid for most vehicles under most conditions, although problems may be encountered in off-roadway
situations such as car parks or private lands.
Outdoor map matching techniques can be divided into
three basic types: geometric matching, topological matching, and probabilistic matching. In addition, some filtering
algorithms (e.g., particle filters or extended Kalman filters)
often are utilized in the matching. A geometric matching
algorithm makes use of the geometric information of the
spatial road networks by considering only the shape of
the links, instead of the relationship of the links. This
algorithm can be further divided into three subtypes: pointto-point matching, point-to-curve matching, and curve-tocurve matching [107]. Topological matching makes use of the
geometry as well as the connectivity and contiguity of the
links [108]. The probabilistic matching requires the definition
of an elliptical or rectangular confidence region around a
position obtained from a navigation sensor. Typically, this
region can be obtained based on GPS positioning results and
its error variance. Then, this region will be superimposed
on the road network to determine a road segment on which

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
the vehicle is traveling. The road networks or segments
of outdoor environments mainly contain the properties of
width and length. In contrast, indoor environments have
a completely different scale, and the internal structure is
also more complicated. Also, most of the indoor localization
applications are pedestrian-oriented and other slow moving
targets. Compared with the fixed movement patterns of cars
on the roads, which is always along the road direction,
humans’ indoor movement behaviors have high randomicity
and are not unpredictable. In sum, indoor map matching
algorithm has a large difference from that of the outdoors, and
next we will explore the indoor map matching techniques in
detail.
Indoor environments and outdoor environments have
similar spatial constraints, which can be used to rule out some
incorrect positioning results, thereby improving the accuracy of traditional positioning techniques. Theoretically, the
estimated results of targets could be anywhere that the positioning infrastructure covers. Actually, it is impossible for targets especially pedestrians to be at some specific places due to
the constraints of indoor spaces. Moreover, indoor spaces are
typically divided into rooms, corridors, stairs, and other
building structures. For instance, it is unreasonable that the
estimated location is in the area occupied by obstacles. If two
consecutive estimations with 1 s interval cross a wall and they
are far away from the nearest exit (e.g., door) of the wall, we
think this kind of trajectory is incorrect.
Similarly, indoor map matching methods can also be
divided into three categories: point-to-point matching
(geometry), trajectory matching (topology), and Bayesian
methods. Point-to-point algorithms match the estimated
coordinate points with the locations of indoor environments
based on floor plans. The most typical point-to-point
algorithm is the landmark matching [21], which first
observes some sensor data or detects users’ activities and
then calibrates targets’ locations to some landmarks, such as
visible landmarks (e.g., elevators, stairs, and corners) or
virtual landmarks (e.g., the spot with an unusual magnetic or
wireless signal fluctuation). Landmarks-based localization is
a relatively new technology, which involves a wide range of
background knowledge, so we will elaborate it in Section 6.2.
Trajectory or topology matching usually makes use of
the geometry and topology information of corridors, corners,
and rooms, which is matched with captured trajectory to
obtain a global optimal estimation. Lan and Shih [109]
inferred the user’s last-visited corner by calculating the geometric similarity between the user trajectory and that of the
floor plan. To be specific, the geometric similarity between
two graphs was estimated by comparing their shapes, vertex
angles, and relative edge lengths. In this way, map matching
could calibrate PDR errors caused by gyroscopes. Park and
Teller [110] proposed the concept of motion compatibility for
indoor localization, assuming that users’ initial locations were
unknown and they walked with smartphones in the indoor
space. After a period of time, a trajectory would be generated
and a sequence of user motions such as walking, turning, or
opening the doors were also detected along the trajectory by
using the user’s inertial sensors. Finally, the floor path whose

21
activities were best matched with the sensed activities was
regarded as the estimated trajectory.
In fact, a more effective method is to use the Bayesian
techniques to reduce uncertainty of the location estimations
that violate the space constraints, such as walking through
walls or obstacles. Bayes filters (e.g., Kalman filters, particle
filters, or HMM) are the most commonly used techniques for
fusing spatial constraints or contexts [32, 111]. To illustrate, we
take particle filter as an example to introduce the basic fusion
approach, in which space constraints are mainly used for
updating the weights of particles. If the predicted location of
a particle is considered to be invalid, the weight of the particle
will be assigned to 0. Also, we should make sure that newly
generated particles are not in the invalid areas when initiating
and resampling particles:
resides in invalid areas
{0
𝑝 (𝑥𝑘󸀠 | 𝑥𝑘−1 ) = {
(59)
𝑝 (𝑥𝑘−1 ) otherwise.
{

Particularly, Widyawan et al. [68] proposed a backtracking
particle filter for fusing map matching and PDR, which
mainly used the historical trajectories of particles to improve
estimations. If particle 𝑥𝑘𝑖 is invalid at time 𝑘, the previous
state estimates at time 𝑘 − 𝑀 can be refined by removing the
invalid particle trajectories. This is based on the assumption
that an invalid particle is the result of a particle that follows an
invalid trajectory or path. Obviously, the recalculation of the
previous state estimation 𝑥𝑘−𝑀 without invalid trajectories
will facilitate better estimates. If elevators, stairs, and other
vertical passages are represented in the maps and barometers
are used to measure the altitude of the building floor [13], not
only can we refine the 2D location estimations but also we can
refine 3D localization results.
In addition to refining localization accuracy, map matching can also be used to calibrate the error of heading sensors
(e.g., the compass and gyroscope). Li et al. [65] used an
enhanced particle filter to model users states, including the
position, step length, and heading. When tracking users in
corridors, the most likely reason for particles to cross walls
is the heading estimation error rather than step length model
error. Therefore, the corresponding particles are removed and
we only resample the heading for newly generated particles
while the step length model remains the same. Bao and Wong
[32] used map matching to improve the localization accuracy
and calibrate the error of moving heading. The algorithm
first determined if users were walking on corridors and then
the heading of corridors was utilized to calibrate the moving
heading of users.
Point-to-point matching is simple and has high operation
efficiency, which can be treated as a search process. Yet it
is sensitive to the recognition rate of landmarks, and incorrect matching may result in the bigger localization errors.
Additionally, it is difficult to correctly match user’s current
location to one of two specific locations being near each other
(e.g., two corners with approximately equal angles and two
locations with an unusual magnetic fluctuation).
Trajectory matching considers more geometric and topological information. It has better robustness and smaller

22
matching error than point-to-point matching, though the
algorithm complexity is higher. The biggest weakness is that
its real time capability is poor because the matching process
starts only when the walking trajectory becomes long enough.
Map matching algorithms based on Bayesian theory can
finely represent the probability of each location and update
the probability with the spatial constraints in maps. Compared with point-to-point matching and trajectory matching
which use spatial contexts in a coarse-grained level, Bayesian
approaches obviously can achieve better localization accuracy
and high real time ability. However, they are computationally
expensive. Concerning this issue, Xiao et al. [112] proposed
a lightweight map matching algorithm, which replaced
Bayesian techniques (e.g., Kalman filters, particle filters, and
HMM) with conditional random field (CRF), to fuse multiple
localization techniques (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and PDR)
and the floor plan. Unlike existing techniques that model
the problem using directed graphical models, the proposed
algorithm used an undirected graphical model which was
particularly flexible and expressive. CRF allowed a single
observation to be related with multiple states and multiple
observations to inform a single state. Therefore, it could
express the extent to which observations support not only
states but also state transitions. Experiments showed that
CRF was more computationally efficient than traditional
techniques and it was able to accurately track the location of
a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements
only.
Map matching can significantly improve the localization
accuracy. Moreover, there are no additional requirements
on mobile devices and infrastructures except a digital map.
Therefore, among many studies, map matching is always an
indispensable component of optimizing methods for indoor
mobile location estimation. However, detailed indoor maps
in many environments may not always be readily available. On that issue, simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) and crowdsourcing techniques [113–115] have been
used to automatically construct reliable indoor maps.
6.2. Landmarks-Aided Estimation. Landmarks are features
or unique signatures which can be easily reobserved and
distinguished from the environment and can also help people to recognize the space [116]. Landmarks have typical
characteristics: easily reobservable, distinguishable from each
other, and stationary. For instance, the Statue of Liberty
is just a good landmark as it is unique and can easily be
seen from various locations. Actually, landmarks for indoor
localization are originally used in SLAM [117, 118], in which
landmarks are also named geometric beacons. SLAM is used
to track robots moving in unknown environment and simultaneously construct the indoor maps. In particular, indoor
mapping refers to capturing the landmarks (e.g., planes,
corners, cylinders, and obstacles) when a robot is moving
in the unknown environment and determining its location.
Then, a simple indoor map is constructed based on these
landmarks whose locations have been determined. When a
robot reports a newly observed landmark, the algorithm will
match the landmark with the constructed map and determine

the robot’s location. The workflow of typical SLAM algorithms is shown in Figure 12.
Currently, most of users’ mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) have been equipped with many advanced
wireless modules (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and IMU sensors (e.g., accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes).
Therefore, users have the access to many landmarks like
robots. Wang et al. [21] proposed to use the smartphones to
sense the landmarks in indoor environments which could
then help to improve the localization accuracy of users.
Landmarks are certain locations of indoor environments
where signatures are identifiable on one or more sensing
dimensions. For instance, an elevator imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone’s accelerometers; a corridor-corner may
denote a big angle change measured by gyroscopes; a specific
spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation; we
may encounter some signal blind areas where there are no
wireless signals at all, such as Wi-Fi and GSM. Shen et al.
[33] treated the places in the corridors where Wi-Fi RSS
presented a peak value as landmarks, that is, Wi-Fi-Marks.
Normally, the trend of the received Wi-Fi signal strength
changes from increasing to decreasing when moving along
the pathway. In fact, these kinds of landmarks naturally exist
in the environments, and the number is large. Most often,
in the offline phase, we obtain the locations of landmarks
through map searching and/or machine learning. Then when
the mobile user observes these landmarks during the online
phase, the user’s location can be calibrated by the locations of
these landmarks.
Landmarks can be further classified into seed landmarks
and organic landmarks. The former is often the building
components and indoor facilities (e.g., elevators, stairs, and
exits). At these places, the sensor readings would present
some special characteristics. Particularly, the locations of seed
landmarks can be easily obtained through indoor maps. In
order to distinguish different activities (e.g., climbing up and
down elevators, walking up and down stairs, and walking on
floors), some classification approaches are needed such as
the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and the
decision tree [119, 120]. Organic landmarks cannot be directly
obtained through searching maps; instead they are perceived
by sensor data. For example, magnetic fluctuation spots have
to be identified with magnetometers. The locations could be
also derived through some automatic learning approaches,
such as clustering techniques (e.g., 𝐾-means and DBSCAN).
Because landmarks are only related to the physical space,
theoretically, landmark-based localization does not depend

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
on infrastructures and the only one thing needed is the
mobile device equipped with IMU sensors for perceiving
landmarks. Therefore, landmark-based localization is generally considered as a low-cost solution for accuracy improvement compared with other traditional solutions.
The key challenge for this solution is the correct recognition and matching of landmarks. The main factors that affect
the recognition and matching of landmarks are the changes of
environment, heterogeneous mobile devices, and differences
between training objects. The changes of environment can
give rise to the changes of locations of landmarks and
further the recognition and matching errors. For instance,
the addition of new Wi-Fi APs in the environment representatively may result in the disappearance of some previously
existing Wi-Fi signal blind areas; the movement of a metal
object location is likely to cause the location changes of
magnetic fluctuation spots. For the changes of landmarks, we
have to adaptively learn the changes, whatever the changes
are. Moreover, the sensor readings derived from the same
landmarks may be very different if heterogeneous mobile
devices are used, because of the same reasons mentioned
in Section 2.2.2. Taking the Wi-Fi signal blind area as an
example, phones of brand B have a smaller Wi-Fi RSS value
than that of brand A according to our experimental results.
In our experiments, when measuring the RSS value from the
same AP at the same location, the RSS for phones of brand
B is −78, while that for phones of brand A is −60. If the
RSS value is below −100, we will regard the corresponding
AP as invisible. Therefore, when a spot is determined as the
signal blind area with phones of brand B, this is not the case
for phones of brand A. As for this issue, we can suppose
phones of the same brand have the same or similar sensor
specification. During the process of learning landmarks, it
is necessary to extract and record sensor readings with the
brand of the phones. While matching landmarks, only these
landmarks with the same brand will be chosen and matched.
In addition, the difference of motion patterns from training
users may lead to the training results being invalid. This
means the sensor reading learnt by a user at a landmark
may be inconsistent with that collected by another user at
the same landmark, for example, assuming that there are two
users A and B performing the training task where A is much
taller than B. Because taller people tend to have a greater
acceleration compared with shorter one, the incorrect activity
recognition can occur if we use the data collected by A to
match with the data from B.
To further address the landmarks mismatching issue, the
batch gating [121] and trajectory matching [110] can be used,
which match multiple landmarks (i.e., several continuous
landmarks detected on a traveling path) at one time.
6.3. Spatial Models-Aided Estimation. Although map matching can improve the location estimation, it primarily uses
the geometric and topologic information of indoor spaces
to constrain targets’ movement and only limited spatial
information is utilized. Moreover, landmarks can calibrate
the localization results and it is a low-cost solution for
improving localization accuracy. However, it is not easy to

23
correctly identify enough landmarks. Landmarks matching
is another challenge for this technique. An indoor spatial
model [35, 122] typically represents the static and mobile
real-world objects and their properties such as locations
and spatial relationships in indoor moving environment.
Static objects commonly include the building, floors, rooms,
doors, sensors, obstacles, and other objects of interest. Mobile
objects generally refer to the persons. A typical spatial model
contains more fine-grained and rich geometric, topological,
and semantic information, which can be used to further
improve the location estimation and further realize richer and
more reliable location services [35, 122, 123]. Currently, the
most commonly used spatial models for assisting localization
are grid models [124] and graph models [125, 126]. Correspondingly, spatial model-aided localization approaches can
fall into grid-based methods and graph-based methods.
6.3.1. Grid Model-Based Methods. The grid model partitions
a space into regular cells with semantics (e.g., wall, obstacle,
and open area); for example, a piece of room is considered
a grid cell, and each grid cell is linked to its neighbors. The
size of each grid is also able to be adjusted for different
applications. Since the grid model does not abstract the space,
it is able to describe the locations of almost all objects in
indoor environments accurately and continuously.
Each grid contains a value for the probability that the
tracked object is located within this cell. Obviously, for
static objects, that is, obstacles (e.g., furniture and walls),
the probability for corresponding cells is 0. The grid model
is especially suitable for computation, because it can be
also regarded as a matrix which enables many matrix-based
computation. The drawbacks of the gird model are that it
needs to store too many grids in the memory and update the
probability of all grids when new observations are available.
Therefore, the model faces the challenge of high memory
cost and computational complexity. Moreover, the number
of grids needed grows exponentially with the dimension of
grids; hence it is just used to solve low-dimension problems,
such as the heading or location of users. Figure 13 shows a
square-shaped grid model.
Fox et al. [127] proposed a grid-based Markov localization
algorithm. It used a fine-grained grid model to represent the
state space of robots and divides the indoor space into regular
3D grids (10 cm–40 cm). When the robot moved or received
new sensor data (ultrasound sensors), the probability of each
state (grid) was updated. To update the state spaces efficiently,
two techniques were developed: precomputation of the
sensor model and the selective update scheme. Bohn and
Vogt [128] proposed a high-level sensor fusion architecture
which could support an arbitrary number of sensors. The
probabilistic localization algorithm was used to fuse map
knowledge and high-level sensor to increase the accuracy and
plausibility. The indoor space was represented as a 2D grid
with a fixed cell size. Each cell contains three probabilities: the
probability that the target was located within this cell;
probabilities for movement into the eight adjacent cells;
probability for staying in the cell. Invalid locations (e.g., walls
and obstacles) had an influence on the probability calculation

24

of cells. The cell with the maximum probability would be
selected as the target’s location. Bhattacharya et al. [129]
divided the grocery into cells with the same size. The grid
model was applied to constrain the localization results of
targets, so as to improve the localization accuracy of Wi-Fi
fingerprinting.
Essentially, the spatial model-based methods use the spatial constraints to limit the movement of targets. The location
of targets is narrowed to a smaller probability space, so as to
automatically rule out some erroneous estimations. The key
point lies in the mining of available spatial information to
constrain users’ movement which is represented in the spatial
model. Some typical spatial constraints represented in the
grid model are as follows.
(i) Buffer: a buffer is defined as a search region of
current location and centers at the known previous
location. The range of the buffer usually depends on
the walking speed and the time interval of location
determination. We just need to determine users’
location within the buffer, and the locations out of the
buffer can be ruled out directly.
(ii) Shortest path distance: based on the spatial connectivity of grid model, there are several algorithms
to calculate the shortest path distance, for example,
Dijkstra’s algorithm, A∗ search algorithm, and so
on. Different from the shortest path distance, the
Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance without considering the obstacles or walls between two
cells (Figure 14). Obviously, the shortest path distance
is more reasonable than the Euclidean distance to
represent the distance users move in the indoor
environment. In order to obtain the range of the
buffer, we need to determine whether it is possible
for a user to travel from the current location to each
cell of grid model in a certain interval (e.g., 2 s). For
example, assuming a user walk at about 1.5 m/s and
the interval between two location estimations is 2 s,
these cells with a shortest path distance below 3 m to
the user’s current location will be added to the buffer,
while the others will be excluded.
(iii) Moving heading: if there is no turn at the previous
location, we believe that there is a very high probability that the current moving direction is the same as

Figure 14: The Euclidean distance and the shortest path distance
between two cells.

the previous one. Based on this assumption, we can
further rule out some cells out of the range of the
moving heading with a deviation angle. For instance,
we can calculate the angle between the current moving heading and the surrounding cells. When this
angle is beyond an angle threshold (e.g., 30), the
corresponding cell is invalid. While for the cells
fulfilling this requirement, they will be assigned with
different probability values according to the angle.
Figure 15 describes the angle between the heading
vectors of the grid cells.
(iv) Occupancy grid: users cannot freely move in the
indoor environment, because it often have only limited free space (e.g., rooms and corridors) and may
contain a number of obstacles (e.g., desks and walls).
These physical structures occupy some cells of the
grid model, to which users cannot move. Therefore,
these occupancy grids can be deleted from the candidate grid cells for users’ location estimation; that is,
the probabilities for the occupancy grids should be set
to 0.
In addition, many other spatial constraints represented in
grid model can also be used. For instance, the one-way
passage (e.g., the check-in path of the metros) only permits
the moving along one direction and the other is forbidden;

users tend to walk on the central area of the corridors, instead
of close to the walls; the opening and closing state of the doors
also affect users’ movement. In sum, grid model can provide
lots of spatial information to improve location estimation.
The research focuses of the method are how to correctly mine,
represent, and use as much spatial constraints as possible.
6.3.2. Graph Model-Based Methods. Grid model is a geometrical spatial model and the computational complexity
of grid model-based location estimation can be reduced
by nonmetric representations of an environment, such as
typical graph model. Actually, in indoor environments, users’
movement is often in a more determined way directed to
some destination than random walk [71]. Moreover, users
normally move in a more natural way. For instance, when
walking in an indoor environment, they tend to move along
the main axes of rooms or corridors. So we can naturally
represent typical human motion on graphs [70]. This can
reduce the degrees of freedom from user movement and
therefore improve location estimation even when using
only sparse, noisy information provided by sensors, such
as enhancing robustness and decreasing the computational
complexity (e.g., the number of particles for particle filtering).
Graph-based motion models represent an indoor space as a
graph where nodes model predefined locations (e.g., places,
doors, and points of interest) extracted either manually or
automatically from the environment, and links or edges
stand for the connections that make it possible to move
through these locations. The graph model can be categorized
into five different kinds [35]: place graphs, visibility graphs,
generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), fine-grained graphs, and
sensor-based graphs. Figure 16 shows the walkable graph
model from Level 4 of our office building.
Krumm et al. [130] used HMM to fuse the graph of
indoor environment for improving the location estimation
of fingerprinting with 433 HZ RF technology. It defined the
transition probabilities between connected nodes according
to the node connectivity in the graph. For example, if the
probability of a target moving from a node in an office to
another node outside the office’s door was 0.05 within 1 s,

25
the probability of the target being in the office was then
0.95. In that case, sensor measurements (e.g., RSS) could be
treated as the observations of HMM. Experiments showed
that the graph model could efficiently enhance the traditional
positioning technologies, especially in robustness. Liao et
al. [70] utilized the Voronoi graph of the environment to
accurately determine the locations of users by representing
typical human motion along the main axes of the free
space. Particularly, the particle filter was used to estimate
the locations of users on the Voronoi graph. Lee and Chen
[131] used a floor model to improve the location estimation of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The floor model allowed to
query the zones (e.g., rooms and corridors) and the paths
between the zones. Moreover, in order to disambiguate the
user’s location, previous locations in the floor model were
used to eliminate candidate locations that were not likely
to be reachable from the previous locations. Jensen et al.
[132] proposed a graph model which could represent the
connectivity and accessibility of the indoor space. Based on
the constructed topological graph, the deployment graph of
RFID readers was built by combining with the maximum
speed of users to improve the tracking accuracy of traditional RFID positioning technique. Nam [133] employed the
topological graph to aid localization. The spatial relationships
between indoor entities (e.g., rooms, corridors, and corners)
and the user’s activity events (e.g., turn left and turn right)
were used to improve the localization accuracy. Particularly,
when the user’s activity (e.g., turning) was detected using
the IMU sensors, estimated trajectory containing sequential
activities would be compared with the topological graph.
In this way, the tracking errors of IMU sensors could be
calibrated. Hilsenbeck et al. [22] designed a fusion method
of multiple sensors based on a variant of the GVG, making
the best of Wi-Fi and motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers,
gyroscopes, and compasses). The particle filter for location
estimation was formulated directly on a fully discretized,
graph-based representation of the indoor environment; that
is, the state space consists of the discretized nodes in the
graph. Particularly, in this model, the narrow parts of the
building were treated as one-dimensional Voronoi diagram
and the large open spaces as two-dimensional grid graph.
Therefore, the proposed localization approach could reduce
the computational complexity and at the same time achieve
high accuracy. Nurminen et al. [71] implemented a graphbased particle filter algorithm for pedestrian tracking. The
graph was used to derive users’ motion model in the environment, while Wi-Fi measurements were used to update the
weights of particles. The main contribution was inferring
users’ motion model via the graph. When the estimated users’
location reached a link endpoint, the probabilities of other
links being selected as the next link were computed based on
the graph.
Graph model-based methods have the merit of high
efficiency because they represent distributions over a smaller
scale of discrete state space, which is the key to decrease
computational complexity as mentioned above. The drawback of graph model, generally, is that the represented indoor
space is relatively coarse-grained and lacks the geometric
details of locations. The graph model-based methods are

often adequate if the sensors in the environment provide
only very imprecise location information. They are especially
suitable for pedestrian localization and tracking.
Although spatial model-based methods (grid-based and
graph-based) can significantly improve the localization performances, constructing a refined spatial model is a laborintensive and time-consuming task. It is true, in particular,
for the large and complex indoor environments, such as
shopping malls. Sometimes, it is even difficult to build the
floor plan, not to mention the more complex spatial model.
Therefore, constructing spatial model only for the purpose
of assisting localization is not cost-effective. A reasonable
solution for this issue is to provide value-added services for
users on the basis of constructed spatial model, for example,
the indoor navigation service, moving objects queries. In this
way, constructing spatial model is worthwhile. For instance,
IndoorGML [134], a candidate OGC standard, aim to provide
a common framework of representation and exchange of
indoor spatial information. Particularly, it is based on the
requirements from indoor navigation and is still facing many
challenges. Recently, crowdsourcing, a promising solution,
brings a hope to the indoor spatial modelling through
users’ trajectories, which is worthwhile to further study
[8, 72, 135].

7. Open Issues and Future Research Directions
The location estimation has always been a hot topic in the
field of indoor localization and tracking, and lots of progress
has been made as mentioned in our review. However, there
are still some open issues limiting the widespread application
of indoor localization techniques, which deserve further
research. For instance, how to reduce the efforts (e.g., on

constructing fingerprint database and floor plans) is still a
tough challenge. Moreover, the current methods of location
estimation can be improved and extended. In this section,
we present a list of some promising research directions of
improvement schemes for indoor location estimation.
(1) Automatically Updating Fingerprint Database. Fingerprinting-based localization requires labor-intensive
on-site survey activities for constructing an accurate
fingerprint database. Although crowdsourcing fingerprinting techniques have been successfully utilized to
generate the fingerprint database [64], it is challenging to update these fingerprints when a change (e.g.,
the removal or addition of an AP and adjustment of
indoor structures) happens. The fingerprints are
commonly influenced by environmental factors, the
brands and models of the devices. The strategies to
automatically update the collected fingerprints especially on a large scale are still required to be further
investigated.
(2) Fusing Multiple Contexts. Existing solutions usually
use the limited spatial contexts. For example, most of
them only utilize indoor maps. In fact, far more contexts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of location
estimation, such as mobile social information [20],
users’ profiles, preferences, and activities. Using more
contexts can lower the cost, reduce uncertainty, and
enhance user experience.
(3) Crowdsourcing Spatial Model Construction. Users’
smart mobile devices are generally equipped with various IMU sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes,
and magnetometers) which can record users’ activities and trajectories at any time and any places.
The tremendous trajectories crowdsourced by users

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
can be utilized to automatically construct and update
the indoor maps without any prior knowledge about
the indoor spaces [8, 72, 135]. However, the indoor
spaces contain abundant semantics, not only the basic
structures represented by a map but also landmarks
and so on. It is a challenging task to construct spatial
models with much more semantics in a crowdsourcing way.
(4) Infrastructure-Less or Device-Free Localization. Most
traditional indoor localization technologies require
users to wear RF tags or carry the mobile devices. This
leads to a rise in the cost of deployment and maintenance. So far, the lack of infrastructure remains one
of the key factors limiting the widespread application
of indoor localization technologies. And more importantly, in some applications, such as the emergency
response and indoor intrusion detection, we cannot
guarantee that localization targets will wear RF tags or
carry the mobile devices. Therefore, the research that
can reduce the dependence on infrastructures [136–
138] and even do not depend on any mobile devices,
that is, device-free, has become a hot topic in recent
years [139, 140].
(5) Performance Evaluation Schemes. There are a lot of
performance indicators for an indoor localization
technique, such as accuracy, complexity, cost, power
consumption, and usability. Different systems or solutions have varying performance; hence it is necessary
to develop a performance evaluation scheme to help
customers choose appropriate devices, systems, or
solutions. For instance, for cost-sensitive applications,
the opportunistic techniques [141] should be adopted;
the semantic localization approach [2, 142] should be
used to enhance the usability and lower the power
consumption for user-friendly cases.
(6) Online Localization Approaches. Most past studies
profit from offline methods where the data are collected in the mobile devices but processed offline on
a back-end server. Although the computation ability
of mobile devices has been significantly enhanced
recently, it is still necessary to develop real time,
online, and energy-saving applications in order to
prolong the battery life and meet the demand in real
world. The major challenge that online localization
methods face is to achieve the ideal performance
trade-off (e.g., accuracy, power consumption, usability, and security) on the resource-limited platform.

8. Conclusion
In this paper, we provided a review of the state-of-theart in the improvement schemes for indoor mobile location estimation, especially targeting probabilistic techniques,
hybrid localization methods, and localization methods by
fusing spatial context. The accurate localization determination is always the most significant challenge in the indoor
localization field, and the key of location estimation is the
representation and fusion of uncertain information from

27
multiple sources. We analyze the main error sources of typical
localization approaches and propose a multilayered conceptual framework for improvement schemes of the location
estimation.
Due to the effect of multipath, NLOS, hardware errors,
and so on, the localization measurements are inevitable to
contain uncertainty in the indoor environment. The Bayes
filters are powerful statistical tools, and they use probabilistic
techniques to estimate the state of dynamic systems from
noisy data. The Bayes filters are especially suitable for filtering
measurements of different levels, such as RSSs, distances,
angles, and even locations, as well as fusing multiple sensor
data. Therefore, Bayes filters have become the basic mathematical models and tools used in the majority of location
estimation approaches. The most commonly used Bayes
filters include Kalman filters, extended Kalman filters, sigmapoint Kalman filters, particle filters, and HMM. Each indoor
localization technology or approach has its own inherent
defects, when we comprehensively consider their accuracy,
cost, coverage, complexity, and so on. That is, none of the
techniques can fulfill the requirement of all applications.
Although the Bayesian techniques can significantly reduce
the uncertainty of location estimation to some extent, they
still fail to completely eliminate the inherent drawbacks of
single localization technology or approach. The hybrid localization schemes through fusing multiple localization techniques or measurements can combine each other’s advantages
and, therefore, considerably enhance the location estimation.
We discuss four typical hybrid localization schemes: multimodal fingerprinting, triangulation fusing multiple measurements, method combining wireless positioning with PDR,
and cooperative localization. Although hybrid localization
schemes can effectively improve the localization accuracy,
they depend too much on the localization hardware, and
thereby both the cost and the complexity are high. Actually,
the spatial contexts of the indoor environment, such as the
commonly used indoor maps, can be used to assist the
localization. Recently, the location estimation methods by
fusing spatial contexts especially, such as the landmarks
and indoor spatial models, have become a quite hot topic.
But constructing refined indoor maps or spatial models is
a labor-intensive and time-consuming task and is still a
challenge.
Obviously, every solution has its own drawbacks. The
schemes for indoor mobile location estimation with high
accuracy as well as widely accepted cost, complexity, and
effort are still a challenge. In particular, the improvement of
location estimation is a complicated, comprehensive issue.
As for practical applications, we have to comprehensively
consider the requirements of specific applications on the
accuracy, cost, complexity, deployment efforts, and existing
devices and infrastructures and then choose one or the
combination of multiple technologies and/or approaches
presented in this paper.
