indoor wireless communication. This paper proposes the use of measured
signal strength of Ethernet packets as a sensor for a localization system.
We demonstrate that off-the-shelf hardware can accurately be used for location sensing and real-time tracking by applying a Bayesian localization
framework.

I. INTRODUCTION
The IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet standard is becoming increasingly popular and has been deployed in many indoor environments
[19]. Many mobile robots already make use of wireless networking
for communication. Wireless Ethernet devices measure signal strength
as part of their normal operation. We propose the use of off-the-shelf
wireless Ethernet adapters on a mobile robot as a tool for global pose
estimation. This paper is a feasibility study on the advantages and the
difficulties of using this sensor for robot localization. We believe that
there is a great potential for wireless Ethernet to be applied as an additional input to a sensor-fusion technique for robot localization.
Determining the pose of the robot from physical sensors is a key
problem in robotics, since it plays a pivotal role in various successful
mobile robot systems [4]. Outdoor localization can be achieved
using global positioning systems (GPS) [18]. Using GPS for indoor
localization, however, presents some significant challenges [20]. For
the problem of indoor localization, a variety of other sensors have
been used, such as vision, infrared (IR) and laser range finders. Mobile
robots already employing wireless Ethernet for communication purposes could be retrofitted in software to make use of their adapter as a
location sensor. Such a sensor might be very useful for a low-cost robot
or team of robots wishing to execute global localization, navigation,
and exploration tasks. This is of particular interest for some multirobot
configurations; while communicating, the robots could measure signal
strengths to each other and engage in collaborative localization.
The chief difficulty in localization with wireless Ethernet is predicting signal strength. Radio frequency (RF) signal strength measured
indoors is nonlinear with distance. In addition, it has non-Gaussian
noise, resulting from multipath effects and environmental effects, such

as building geometry, network traffic, presence of people, and atmospheric conditions.
This paper describes a set of experiments with a laptop carried by
a human operator, whereby localization with IEEE 802.11b wireless
Ethernet is shown to be feasible. The focus of this work was to determine the usability of wireless Ethernet as a sensor. This was motivated
by an application in wireless computing, that of locating an intruder
using a laptop [16], [15]. However, it is also a minimalist approach
which isolates the sensor we are testing, and generates results applicable to mobile robotics. To compute position, we apply a scheme in
the spirit of other Bayesian techniques that have been successfully employed in the context of robotics [23]. We show experiments demonstrating that off-the-shelf wireless hardware can accurately be used for
location sensing and tracking with about one-meter precision in a wireless-enabled office building.
1) Related Work: The simplest technique used for mobile robot localization has been dead reckoning. With dead reckoning, errors are
added to the absolute pose estimate and accumulated. Triangulation
techniques were also used. In this case, landmarks are extracted from
the sensor input and then they are used to triangulate the robot’s position. This works when the sensors are reliable, but leaves several problems unaddressed [6]. Kalman filters were also applied for localization
[17], [22], where various sensor data are fused to obtain a new position
estimate. This method is provably optimal when noise distributions are
Gaussian, but typically fails when this assumption breaks down. The
most powerful algorithms to date are based on Bayesian inference, in
particular, Markov models [8], [13], and Monte Carlo localization [7],
[24]. Most often, the workspace is represented by an occupancy grid.
Alternately, the environment can be modeled with a topological map,
e.g., as a generalized Voronoi graph [2]; localization in this paradigm is
based on identifying nodes in the graph from geometric environmental
information [3], [14]. Our research uses the Bayesian approach. We
sample the space, we measure the signal strength at regularly spaced
locations, and calculate the probability distribution.
Localization is a problem that has been also explored in the wireless
community for a wireless device like a laptop computer, usually carried by a human operator. Many systems have been implemented that
use specialized hardware [25], [21]. The RADAR system [1], however,
uses only the 802.11b wireless networking for localization and applies
nearest-neighbor heuristics and triangulation techniques. The authors
report accuracy of 3 m with about 50% probability. While our work
has similar design goals to RADAR, we have taken a very different approach.
2) RF Signal Propagation in Wireless Ethernet: The IEEE
802.11b standard uses RFs in the 2.4-GHz band, which is license
free around the world. Accurate prediction of signal strength from
location is a complex and difficult task, since the signal propagates
by unpredictable means [5], [19]. In the 2.4-GHz frequency band,
microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, 2.4-GHz cordless phones, and
welding equipment can be sources of interference. Signals of this
frequency are absorbed by water, and consequently, people will also
absorb signal since human bodies are almost 70% water. Due to
reflection, refraction, scattering, dependence on atmospheric parameters, and absorption of radio waves by structures inside a building,
the transmitted signal most often reaches the receiver by more than
one path, resulting in a phenomenon known as multipath fading [11].
Signal multipath effects cause the observed signal strength to vary in
unpredictable ways as the receiver position varies, but signal profiles
tend to remain approximately the same over short distances [11].
Many efforts have been made to model radio-signal distribution in an
indoor environment [9], [19]. Although it has been suggested that the

signal propagates according to a log-normal function [9], [10], different
experiments have arrived at different distributions, and a general model
remains unavailable. Our experiments verified this; we concluded that
log-normal fits were only feasible when line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver existed. In our experiments, the noise distributions
of signal strength measured at a fixed location varied greatly. In Fig. 1,
we show two typical examples of the signal. The two distributions correspond to measurements taken over time from the same position. Although there is a dominant mode in both of them, we observe that the
distributions are asymmetric and multimodal (i.e., non-Gaussian).
II. METHODOLOGY
1) Hardware: Our experiments were conducted by a human operator carrying a HP OmniBook 6000 laptop with a PCMCIA LinkSys
wireless Ethernet card. This particular card uses the Intersil Prism2 chip
set. We modified the standard Linux kernel driver to use the base station probe facility of 802.11b [12] to request packets from the base station to obtain the necessary signal-strength measurements. The normal
usage of this facility is for determining which base station has the
strongest signal and should be chosen as the home station for the card.
The card firmware logs and reports eight-bit signal strengths and hardware addresses (MAC addresses) for each response packet received.
Each probe returns between zero and four responses from each base
station within range of the card. Probes can be made safely at frame rate
of between three and six times per second, which will vary with network traffic and location. We remark that this signal is quite thin when
compared with other sensors, such as sonar or a laser range finder. We
estimate that in our setup, there are roughly five meaningful bits of information from each packet, and these bits are noisy.
2) Our Model: The localizer that we implemented operates in the
general framework of Bayesian inference localization [8], [13], [23].
We chose a state space and observation space. Position is represented
as a probability distribution over the states. The inference calculation
consists of conditioning on the observations and then selecting a representative point from the resulting distribution.
We chose points in four hallways of the building where our experiments took place, spaced roughly 1.5 m apart from each other, at two
orientations. A point for our experiments was represented as a tuple
(x; y;  ). To summarize, our state space consisted of a set of n points
S = fs1 = (x1 ; y1 ; 1 ); . . . ; sn = (xn ; yn ; n )g.
Our observation space consisted of the observations that occurred in
a single measurement from our base station scanner. A packet consists
of k pairs of base station MAC address and signal strength. The number
of replies k is different from the number of base stations, which in our
experiments is 14. This is due to the fact that some base stations may

not reply at all, or some of them may reply up to four times. We are
assuming that the number of times a base station is replying to a probe
is independent from the signal strength of the reply. As a result, a single
measurement consists of a count k of the number of base station replies,
a summary of the frequency counts (the number of times each of the N
base stations was seen in this measurement), and then the k pairs. We
denote this as a vector o =< k; f1 ; . . . ; fN ; (b1 ; 1 ); . . . ; (bk ; k ) >,
where k is the count, N is the total number of base stations, fi is the
frequency count for the ith base station, bj is the base station index of
the j th measurement, and j is the signal strength at that point.
At each point si , we take a sample of the observable. For each base
station, we build two histograms at that point. The first is a distribution of the frequency counts over the sampled observations. The
second is a distribution of signal strengths. Based on this sample, we
can calculate two kinds of conditional probability. Pr(fj = a j si ),
the probability that the frequency counts for the j th base station is
equal to a when we are at state si , and Pr(j j bj ; si ), the probability
that the base station bj has signal strength j at state si . For o =<
k; f1 ; . . . ; fN ; (b1 ; 1 ); . . . ; (bk ; k ) >, for each 1  i  n and under
the assumption that the signal strength is independent from the number
of replies, we compute
Pr(ojsi ) =

By explicitly integrating a probability distribution of positions based on
a received measurement and selecting a representative point, we obtain
a position estimate. After trying several possible schemes, we decided
to solve a global localization problem for each measurement rather than
keep a running estimate, because each measurement usually contains
enough information to get a good guess of our position. Initially, we
assign equal probability to all possible states in the building of being
the actual position. Iterating over all states, we compute which position is most likely to have resulted in the measured signal by selecting
the point of maximum probability, assuming that the point exceeds a
certain threshold probability. The resulting stream can be further processed to improve precision (see “Sensor fusion” below).
3) Training Process: Our system was trained by taking samples
every 1.5 m in the world by three different operators. Each operator had
to hold a laptop, and to stand still for several seconds at each sample
point to collect data. We assume that sampled data was operator independent, that is to say, that we believed that measured distributions
would be relatively unaffected by who took the data. The amount of
data taken at each point is varied adaptively according to a simple
heuristic, which measures the rate of convergence to a stable distribution. Once the sampled distribution at each visible base station had

them are located at hallway 1 and hallway 2. Overall 14 different base stations were used. They were located on two different floors.

converged beyond a threshold, we halt the process. This allowed us to
train the system faster, spending more effort only in positions where it
is necessary to achieve an accurate measurement of the signal-strength
distribution. In our case, usual sampling times ranged from 10 s to 1
min per position.
4) Sensor Fusion With a Hidden Markov Model: We implemented
a filter that works on top of the Bayesian inference procedure. It takes
the output of the inference engine as a stream of timed observations
and tries to stabilize the distribution by noting that a person carrying
a laptop typically does not move very quickly. This sort of calculation
could be achieved with a much higher degree of precision using odometry from a mobile robot.
We model a moving operator trying to track her position as a hidden
Markov model (HMM). We use a more finely discretized state space
than the Bayesian inference engine and try to interpolate our position
out of the stream of measurements coming from this filter. We observed
that, by averaging our training measurements taken at a 1.5 m spacing,
and using the average measurement for the points in between, we were
able to localize the computer for points where we had not taken any
training samples.

For our purposes, an HMM is a set of states S = fs1 ; . . . ; sn g,
a set of observations O = fo1 ; . . . ; om g, a conditional probability
 : S 2 O ! [0; 1], and a transition probability matrix A. As in the
Bayesian inference engine, each state is a point (x; y; ).
The transition probability matrix semantics describe how the system
being modeled evolves with time. In this case, it describes how a person
travels through the state space. If  is a probability distribution over S ,
then 0 = A is the probability distribution after some discrete time
step. The idea is that the random state change occurs, “hidden” from
the observer.
The observation function  has semantics identical to observation in
the Bayesian inference of position. (s; o) = Pr(ojs), the probability
of observing o while at s. As each observation arrives,  is used to
update the probability of being in a given state in S , and then A is
used to transition states.  is chosen to be a model of the behavior of
the inference engine, and A is chosen to heuristically model human
motion.

III. RESULTS
In our experiments, we can measure and track position robustly.
In over 70% of our localization attempts, we return either the closest
trained position or an adjacent trained position, i.e., we achieved 1.5-m
accuracy. Although this may seem as a large error for indoor localization, it must be noted that errors are not accumulated as in the case of
odometry, and that this sensor comes almost for free, since we achieved
this level of accuracy in a complex indoor environment by employing
commodity 802.11b Ethernet equipment. The map of the building we
operated in can be found in Fig. 2. It had fairly complicated geometry
and the base stations were laid out more than a year before we began
our work. We did not make any changes to the original base station locations in our building.
Figs. 3 and 4 show tracking experiments that took place in hallways
1 and 3 of our building, respectively. The operator walked down the
hallway, indicating the exact time that certain milestones were passed,
giving us an accurate measure of the operator’s true position to compare against the localization results. In the figures, we report both the
Bayesian inference static localization results and the HMM fused results. In Fig. 3, a significant improvement is obtained and, overall, the
results are excellent. In Fig. 4, the signal was much noisier, due to a
relatively poor base station placement. Note that in both cases, errors
of 1.5 m are still roughly within one standard deviation.
IV. SUMMARY
Bayesian techniques applied to signal-strength measurements from
802.11b wireless Ethernet allow for real-time and accurate localization. Our work provides a strong indication that both human and robot
agents can use their existing wireless network interfaces, which currently serve only as communication devices, as a low-cost localization sensor. The infrastructure for such networks already exists in many
real-world environments, and consequently, our scheme can be implemented as a software-only solution.
The experiments were conducted by human operators which introduced error due to signal absorption and lack of odometry. Nevertheless, the results are valid for localization carried with different hardware
or with a mobile robot. In fact, similar experiments carried out with a

Fig. 3. Measured error for walking up and down hallway 1, shown on the right graph, is within 1 m with probability 0.64, an improvement of 45% over static
localization. This improvement is illustrated in the actual tracking performance, shown in the left graph.

While sensor fusion provided some improvement, it was not significant, due to pathological behavior of static localization in certain regions, like hallway

robot would likely be significantly more precise, as we avoid absorption errors induced by the operator and have odometry as an additional
sensor. Furthermore, there was no effort to improve the quality of the
localization procedure by placing the base stations so as to better cover
the area where the experiments took place. In an indoor environment,
the multipath-fading phenomenon, interference, absorption, reflection,
and refraction can not be avoided. However, our results suggest that
signal-strength measurement from the 802.11b wireless Ethernet devices are useful cues for localization.
There are many interesting open problems related to the use of wireless Ethernet as a localization sensor, such as the behavior of the signal
in dynamic environments. Most of our experiments were taken during
the night. During daytime, new problems in localization arise both from
the absorption of signal by human bodies and from the heavier network
traffic. Furthermore, the framework we have proposed is not restricted
to corridor localization where the laptop operator or the robot is forced
to walk almost on a straight line. Experiments in large open rooms and
on multiple floors can provide further insights on the functionality of
wireless Ethernet as a sensor for localization. Last, but not least, is the
issue of base station location. Poor initial placement of base stations can

severely decrease the efficiency of localization attempts. Techniques
that can provide suggestions for the number and the placement of base
stations in order to efficiently cover an environment can significantly
improve the performance of localization methods.

Integrated Sensing and Filter Design for a
Single-Link Flexible Manipulator
G. L. Wang and Y. F. Li
Abstract—This paper addresses the problem of using different sensors
in filter design that can simultaneously satisfy multiple specifications.
A novel approach is taken in the design paradigm that integrates the
sensing strategy with the filter design, which improves the filtering
performance. An application to the estimation of the endpoint vibration
rate of a single-link flexible manipulator is presented with experimental
verifications.
Index Terms—Estimation, filter design, flexible manipulators, performance specifications, sensing.

I. INTRODUCTION
In filter designs, fundamental limitations exist due to the dynamic
effects of system structures. Quantifying these limitations is a research topic that has attracted considerable attention [1]. It has been
recognized that the sensing strategy and sensing system employed can
affect the achievable filtering performance significantly. Classically,
the sensing system is predetermined before filter design is conducted.
In the past, research in filter design has mainly been concerned
with the optimization schemes to include the error variance [2],
-norm minimization [4]. With the optimization-based
[3] and
filter-design method, it is difficult to address a wider range of multiple
specifications, owning to the performance constraints.
In this paper, we explore a simple yet efficient way of making use
of different sensor resources in filter design. In particular, we propose
a design methodology to achieve multiple simultaneous specification
(MSS) filtering via an integrated sensing and filtering-design approach.
This is achieved by a two-step procedure. The first is to find a finite
number of individual specification (IS) filters. This step divides the
MSS requirements into several IS design objectives. That is, each IS
filter focuses on one or a few specification objectives. The second is
the synthesis design stage, where an MSS filter can be found by simply
combining the available IS filters in a convex combination. The relevant idea of using MSS for control purposes was studied in [5] and [6].
A new aspect considered here lies in the exploitation of the benefits of
potential sensor resources for achieving the MSS filtering. More precisely, the sensing-system selection is incorporated into the complete
filter design cycle (see Fig. 1), so as to facilitate the MSS filter design.
This is especially useful when rich sensor resources are available.
This paper is organized into two main parts. First, we describe our
methodology in the context of bounded-error estimator (BEE) [7].
Second, we present the application of our methodology to a single-link
flexible manipulator. The measurement of the flexible modal state
can not be directly achieved via hardware sensors. Estimating it using
