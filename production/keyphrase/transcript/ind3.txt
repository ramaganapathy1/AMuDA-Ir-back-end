Abstract
The location-aware technology and its application
are prerequisite to realize the ubiquitous computing.
However, another special system for indoor
localization is needed in the complicated indoor
environment, where the Global Positioning System
(GPS) is not available. RFID technology makes the
building up of indoor localization system with low cost
possible. LANDMARC is an indoor localization system
using RFID technology, which introduces the concept
of reference tag to reduce the number of deployed
RFID readers and provides high possibility to be used
in reality, and we can guarantee the accuracy of
localization and thus lower the cost of importing
system with it. In this paper, we analyze the existing
LANDMARC system, solve the potential problems
within it and propose a more efficient mechanism to
enhance the accuracy of indoor localization.

1. Introduction
Ubiquitous computing is the major infra technique
of the next generation of information technology,
which means all things such as human, objects,
buildings etc., are equipped with embedded processor
and are able to connect with networks to compute and
exchange information.
Ubiquitous Computing system is composed of
objects which are equipped with embedded processors
and connected together through communication
modules, and it can be accessed anytime and anywhere
and can be easily provided into real world. In other
words, ubiquitous computing system is very useful in
our daily life. Localization application, which is one of
the important usages of ubiquitous computing system,
is obtaining more and more attentions recently, which
makes the development of ubiquitous localization
†

technology and the ubiquitous computing system based
on the technology very necessary.
There have been many universities and research
centers doing researches on automatic localization
technology for years [1]. And these technologies can
be categorized into three main aspects: Triangulation,
Scene Analysis and Proximity, each of which can be
further divided into several detailed technologies.
Global Positioning System (GPS) [2] is a commonly
used localization system nowadays. But for GPS is a
system depending on satellite, it is hard to localization
in the complicated indoor environment.
In order to overcome the disadvantage of GPS and
locate object accurately in the complicated indoor
environments, researchers developed several indoor
location sensing system, such as: Active Badge [4],
which used diffuse infrared technology to realize
indoor location positioning; RADAR [3] [5], an RF
based system for locating and tracking objects inside
buildings using a standard IEEE 802.11 network
adapter; Cricket Location Support System [6] and
Active Bat [8] location system based on ultrasonic
technology; and SpotON [7][9][10], which is a wellknown location sensing systems using the RFID
technology. Some other technologies, such as
composing Sensor network or RFID system with
sensors which are embedded with reading Tags [12],
are also being investigated. All these indoor
localization systems have their own advantages and
limitation as well, among which the location sensing
system use commercially available RFID devices can
reduce construction cost.
LANDMARC [11] which is developed by Michigan
State University and Hong Kong University of Science
& Technology together is a typical example
(prototype) of indoor localization system using RFID
technology. LANDMARC introduces the concept of
reference tag to reduce the number of deployed RFID
readers and guarantee the accuracy of localization at

the same time, and thus can lower the cost of importing
system and can be easily used in the real world.
In this paper, we analyze the existing LANDMARC
system, and propose a mechanism with more
efficiency, stability and accuracy to solve the potential
problems within LANDMARC, and our purpose is to
enhance the accuracy of indoor localization.

2. LANDMARC System
With the purpose of increasing the locating
accuracy with less RFID Reader, LANDMARC utilize
the concept of Reference Tag. Reference Tags are the
Active Tags whose locations are fixed to help location
calibration, and they serve as reference points in the
system. This approach has three major advantages:
First, there is no need for a large number of
expensive RFID readers, and use extra, cheaper RFID
tags instead, thus can be more practical due to cost
constraint.
Second, the environmental changes can easily be
accommodated. The signal strength and detecting
range of a same tag can be various in a complicated
indoor environment, so it is hard to estimate the
distance between Reader and Tag only by the detected
signal strength. But for the reference tags are subject to
the same effect in the environment as the tags to be
located, this approach helps offset many environmental
factors that contribute to the variations in detected
range.
Third, the location information is more accurate and
reliable.
The main focus of LANDMARC is to find out the
tracking tags’ nearest neighbour Reference Tags by
comparing the signal strength of tracking tags and
reference tags detected by reader, and grant the
selected reference tags whose signal strength is close
to the tracking tags’ higher weighting value, and then
obtain the object location by computing the weighting
value and the reference tags’ real positions.
Suppose we have n RFID Readers along with m
reference tags in an indoor location sensing system,
and each RFID reader is configured with continuous
mode, which means it reports the tags that are within
the specified range continuously. We define the signal
&
strength vector of a tracking tag as S (S1 , S2 ,...,Sn )
and the corresponding signal strength vector for
&
reference tags as T (T 1 , T 2 ,..., T n ) . The Euclidian
distance in signal strength between a tracking tag and a

the location relationship between the reference tags
and the tracking tag, and the smaller the E value is,
the nearer reference tag is to the tracking tag. And
&
then, with the E vector E ( E1 , E 2 ,..., E m ) of m
reference tags, LANDMARC will choose k reference
tags with smallest E values as the neighbour tags, and
obtain the tracking tag’s location by

3. Problems with LANDMARC
LANDMARC approach does show that active
RFID is a viable cost-effective candidate for indoor
localization, but it still has the following problems:
First, all the reference tags are supposed to be
candidates when choosing the neighbor tags and this
will bring in much unnecessary computation. For to
choose the neighbor tags, LANDMARC will compute
all the Euclidian distances between the tracking tag
and every reference tag using the function

 S i ) 2 , j  (1, m) and compare different

E values. As shown in Figure 1, only reader 2, 3 and
4 are able to detect the target tag, so the reference tags
which are beyond the detecting range of reader 2, 3
and 4 have little chance to be near to the target tag. But
if we use the function above directly, the reference tags
which are only within the reader 1’s detecting range
will participate in the computation too, and thus lead to
unnecessary computations and increase the server’s
working load, and this will also contribute to the
system latency and affect the reporting of the target’s
location in time.
Second, for the target tag’s location is obtained by
the neighboring tags, the accuracy of locating result
relies on the placement of reference tags, especially the
density of the deployed reference tags. In other word,
because we simply compute the location of tracking
tag with neighboring reference tags and their
weighting values, the error range of the locating result
can be constrained in a polygon composed of
neighboring reference tags. The lower deployment
density of reference tags, the higher error range will be
result in. So in order to decrease the result error, we
should deploy the reference tags at a high density, and

as a result, we need more reference tags. But with
more tags, the interference among tags will be more
serious when reader detecting signals from them, and
the accuracy of the detected signal strength between
tags and reader will be affected.

Then we choose k reference tags with lowest E
values as the neighboring tags, and use K donates the
collection of the k neighboring tags. The coordinate

are 10 tracking tags on different positions and we
conduct the experiment by locating each of them 100
times. The locating result is defined as

From Figure 4 we can see that, in the same indoor
environment, the estimate error can be remarkably
reduced using the proposed mechanism to locate the
target tag than using the existing LANDMARC system.

6. Conclusions
This paper analyze the LANDMARC system, an
indoor location sensing system based on RFID
technology, and proposed a more efficient, effective
and accurate mechanism and solve the problems with
LANDMARC. The proposed mechanism can reduce
computing load by reducing the number of candidates
for neighboring tags, and thus reduce the latency in
locating. When the neighboring tags are selected,
while LANDMARC just simply compute the target
coordinate with positions of the neighboring tags and
their granted weighting values, the proposed
mechanism get the target coordinate by further adding
the computed coordinate result with the average error
range of all the neighboring tags, and thus can reach
higher locating accuracy.
