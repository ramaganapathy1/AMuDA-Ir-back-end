Abstract—This paper pursues RFID support for localization, aiming to pinpoint an object in 3D space. Given a set of RFID tags and/or
readers deployed as reference points at known locations in a hexahedron (like shipping container or storage room), a passive and an
active localization schemes are considered in this paper. Being the very first range-free 3D localization, our schemes depend solely on
RFID tags and readers without other devices or sensors, and it avoids the need of distance estimation according to received wireless
signal strength or phase difference. Our passive scheme locates an RFID tag attached to the target object, with both tags and readers
as reference points. The active scheme locates an RFID reader, by iteratively determining a 3D sphere best covering the activated
reference tags, referred to as the decision boundary optimization scheme (DeB). Results by simulations and testbed experiments
using Alien RFID kits have been obtained, and they reveal that DeB outperforms its passive counterpart and achieves the localization
error of 0.07 ft. Additionally, DeB yields better location accuracy and yet is much faster than a previous counterpart. With enhanced
DeB (EDeB), accuracy of an object located near a hexahedron side or corner is improved considerably.

INTRODUCTION

R

ADIO frequency identification (RFID) has gained widespread adoption for automatic operation and tracking
lately [20], [23]. An RFID system consists of two components, the transponder (or tag) and the detector (or reader).
The RFID tags are categorized as either passive or active
ones. A passive tag possesses a coupling element and a
small, inexpensive electronic microchip, operating without
a separate external power source. It is activated only when
situated within the interrogation range of a reader, which
supplies required power to the transponder through the
coupling unit. An active RFID tag, on the other hand, is
powered by an internal battery to enable a longer operating
range, albeit to a larger size and higher price. Currently, the
RFID reader chip can be made very tiny in size, smaller
than a US quarter [21]. With low power, such an RFID
reader chip is designed to equip portable electronic devices
(e.g., smart phones, PDAs, and so on) with RFID technology. It is expected that diverse applications will be
developed out of such small sized RFID gear.
Object localization is one of the most important applications of the RFID system to determine the rough trajectory
of a moving target or the presence of an object [6], [20], [23].
It is usually realized by deploying RFID tags and/or
readers at known positions to compute the possible location

of a target object. For example, readers may be deployed in
strategic locations in a warehouse or workshop. When an
object with an RFID tag passes the reader, the system
detects the rough location of the object. Alternatively, if a
set of RFID tags are placed at known locations as reference
points, a person carrying a portable electronic device with
an embedded tiny RFID reader (or a robot equipped with
an RFID reader [13], [25], [27]) can obtain rough location
information according to the responses of nearby reference
tags. While locating RFID tags is better known, positioning
RFID readers can gain importance when tiny RFID reader
chips are popularly embedded in smart phones (or other
portable electronic devices), an expected technological
development trend. In particular, given the fact that readers
are much more reliable than tags, such positioning
technology may be applied for security and safety monitoring. For example, if an individual carrying a smart phone
with an embedded RFID reader walks close to a dangerous
area (e.g., a radiation or restrictive zone), an alert/alarm
will be raised immediately.
The problem of RFID localization on 2D planes has been
investigated extensively [4], [13], [14], [15], [17], [19], [22],
[25], while increased attention is given to positioning in its
3D counterpart [8], [9], [23]. The localization approaches
largely fall into two categories [7]: distance-based (DIS, also
known as range-based) and range-free (RAF). A DIS
technique is based on estimated distances between transponders (or tags) and detectors (or readers) [10]. Such a
technique often suffers from low accuracy in distance
estimation due to complex environments and dynamic
channel conditions. As a result, two RAF positioning
schemes (i.e., a passive and an active ones) are considered
here, doing away with distance estimation altogether. Our
passive scheme locates an RFID tag, which is attached to the
target object, based on a Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization method to minimize error objective functions using
RFID tags and readers deployed as the reference points. It is,

thus, named as the Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization
scheme (first introduced in our prior publication [23]). On the
other hand, our active scheme locates an RFID reader, with
only RFID tags as the reference points and without other
devices or sensors (like video cameras, odometers, built-in
distance, angle sensors, and so on, exemplified in [13], [14],
[15], [19]) for localization support. It follows an iteration
process, dubbed decision boundary optimization (DeB),
aiming to determine a sphere model, which is the best fit of
the activated reference tags such that the sphere center is the
estimated target position. Being RAF, our both localization
schemes avoid the need of distance estimation according to
received wireless signal strength (known to be notoriously
inaccurate) [9], [13] or phase difference (being complicated)
[3], [5], [8]. Consequently, their accuracy levels are expected
to be independent of the types of readers (which often exhibit
different radiation patterns). Moreover, our active scheme is
less expensive than earlier ones, which rely on localization
support of other devices or sensors [13], [14], [15], [19] to
achieve desired positioning accuracy, and faster in coordinate calculation than other methods, which call for repeated
activation of nearby tags to progressively reach desirable
localization accuracy [6], [25], [27].
In this work, we consider a hexahedron space in which
target objects are to be localized. We carry out analyses,
extensive simulations, and testbed experiments by using the
Alien RFID kits [1], [2] to evaluate the proposed localization
schemes. Both schemes meet the desired accuracy requirement (i.e., to limit the error of the coordinates to less than
5 percent of the longest edge of the hexahedron) of
applications such as 3D packaging and tracking in containers
or storage rooms. The errors are mainly due to asymmetric
antenna gains, limited radio ranges, significant multipath
fading, unreliable signal transmission, irregular coverage by
reader’s interrogation signals (called coverage irregularity,
as also shown in the sensitivity and orientation chart of
ALN-9540 Squiggle passive tags [1]), and border/corner
effects commonly existing in RFID systems, which together
lead to various degrees of false positive reads (that detect
tags outside the presumed interrogation range) and false
negative reads (that miss tags inside the interrogation range)
in RFID systems. To further enhance localization accuracy,
we exploit multiple antennas (in contrast to the use of
multiple readers or mobile readers), as detailed in Section
3.4. Note that it is common for an RFID reader to support
multiple antennas. For example, an Alien Technology’s
ALR-9900 reader (employed in our testbed experiments)
provides four antenna connectors [2]. Moreover, we propose
tag compensation to deal with “wall adversary,” as to be
discussed in Section 5.2.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
discusses related work. Section 3 introduces our proposed
passive and active 3D positioning schemes. Simulation and
testbed experimental results are presented in Sections 4 and
5, respectively. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK

In tandem with widespread adoption of RFID due to
reduced ownership costs, the need of localizing RFID gear
rises as well. Location information is usually critical for
RFID applications, prompting investigation into different

positioning techniques [20], mostly for locating tags. In
general, those techniques may be DIS or RAF, where the
former relies on distance estimation between a tag and the
reader (often making use of received signal strength or
phase difference from tags) and the latter counts on tags,
which respond upon receiving interrogation signals from
the reader. Employing received signal strength [9], [17], a
DIS technique is suitable for locating active tags, whose
signal strength indications received by the reader can be
discriminated. When based on reception phase difference, a
DIS technique needs multiple readers/signals [3], [5] or
supplemental devices (like pan-tilt units [8]) in additional to
RFID gear. Meanwhile, a DIS technique was considered
previously [5], where the RFID reader transmits multiple
signals with different fundamental frequencies to active
tags. A tag then emits backscatter modulated signals, which
are received and demodulated by the reader to calculate the
distance to the tag based on received signal strength
information. The use of phase difference for RFID tag
localization has been exploited recently, involving softwaredefined radio receivers and a pan-tilt unit for experimental
evaluation [8]. However, the complexity of algorithms for
reception phase calculation is high and an additional pantilt unit for accuracy improvement leads to an expensive
method. Separately, LocAtioN iDentification based on
dynaMic Active Rfid Calibration (LANDMARC ) [17]
deploys a set of active RFID tags at designated locations
as references. It utilizes a small number of readers, each
with several transmission power levels. Based on proximity
information of detected reference tags, LANDMARC
estimates the location of a tracking active tag [17], able to
achieve accuracy in the order of a meter only.
In contrast, RAF techniques are applicable to both active
and passive RFID tags, with the latter deemed advantageous due to their low costs, long durability, small
footprints, and no energy losses. RAF techniques have
been explored for wide applications, including autonomous robot navigation and warehouse management [4],
[6], [13], [25], [27]. Such a technique employs the RFID
reader to activate nearby tags, which report their existence
(and perhaps their stored data as well). It can detect the
target tags within the reader’s interrogation signal ranges
(of more than 30 feet for ALN-9540 Squiggle tags [1], based
on our measurement). When the RFID reader is attached to
an autonomous robot for navigation, RAF techniques can
be followed to enhance location information [6] by
detecting its nearby reference tags placed inside a building,
able to greatly lower the time needed for global localization of the mobile robot. Similarly, mobile robot selflocalization was achieved using an RFID reader mounted
on the robot to scan the prearranged tags with the support
vector machine scheme [27]. The preceding two cases [6],
[27] consider the localization of readers carried by mobile
robots. Another RAF technique localizes passive RFID tags
by utilizing the characteristic curves of tag reads and
writes at different signal attenuation levels and at different
distances [25]. In addition, several recent studies on mobile
robot localization relied on the use of RAF techniques
together with other devices or on-robot sensors (like video
cameras, odometers, built-in distance, angle sensors, and
so on) to achieve better positioning accuracy [14], [15], [19].
Note that all known RAF techniques (except for our prior
work [23]) are for 2D localization.

MANEESILP ET AL.: RFID SUPPORT FOR ACCURATE 3D LOCALIZATION

In wireless sensor network (WSN) systems, location
information with coarse accuracy is sufficient for most
applications. Therefore, several RAF localization approaches
have been proposed [7], [10] as cost-effective alternatives to
expensive range-based approaches. The RAF techniques in
WSN also perform well under random node placement and
irregular signal pattern. Separately, effort has been placed on
localization and positioning in general wireless networks
[15], aiming to guide routing and facilitate information
gathering. For example, a self-configurable positioning
mechanism for multihop wireless networks was treated
earlier [26]. The Cricket Location Support System [18] and
the Active Badge Location System [24] have been developed
by employing ultrasonic technology to provide location
information. Like RAF techniques, all those localization
mechanisms for wireless and sensor networks, however, are
limited to 2D localization systems.

2.1 Earlier Nelder-Mead Localization (NeM) Scheme
An earlier localization scheme has been treated in [23],
where Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization is followed to
minimize the error objective functions, called the NeM
scheme. In such a scheme, the reader situated inside a
3D hexahedron activates part of the reference tags placed at
known positions on the ceiling and the floor planes [23].
NeM first builds two circles (one on each plane) to
approximate the shapes of the activated tags in 2D, before
finding the radius and the center of each circle via nonlinear
optimization. The x and y coordinates of the RFID reader
are estimated using the center points of the two circles. Each
circle center is at a point whose distances to chosen
activated tags are as close to one another as possible,
obtained by minimizing the distance variation function. In
other words, NeM carries out distance optimization over a
2D plane first (to get the circle center according to chosen
tags on the plane, be the ceiling or floor plane), deemed as
the 2D optimization phase (outlined next). Once the centers
on both planes are obtained, the z coordinate of the reader
can be calculated accordingly. Different approaches toward
choosing reference tags for coordinate calculation are
studied, including the Inner border method (IBM), Full
border method (FBM), and Solid circle method (SCM) [23].
A Simplex method is employed to find the center (xf , yf ,
0) and radius rf of the circle formed by the chosen set of
reference tags (depend on the chosen methods, i.e., IBM,
FBM, and SCM) on the floor. Then, an error objective
function is defined, and the Nelder-Mead Simplex optimization is then followed to minimize the defined error
objective function. The center (xc , yc , 0) and radius rc of the
circle on the ceiling can be derived similarly. Then, x and
y coordinates of the reader are determined by averaging (xf ,
yf ) and (xc , yc ), and the z coordinate is obtained from rf , rc ,
and the height of the hexahedron. This earlier considered
NeM scheme will be compared with the schemes proposed
here in Sections 4 and 5.

PROPOSED 3D LOCALIZATION SCHEMES

We propose two RFID-based 3D localization schemes,
namely, a passive scheme and an active scheme discussed
in the following sections. The proposed schemes are for
locating an object with reference to a predetermined

1449

arbitrary coordinate system. They are RAF, employing RFID
gear alone without additional devices or sensors. Without
loss of generality, we consider a hexahedron space (like a
shipping container, a storage room, or other hexahedronshaped spaces), whose length, width, and height are L, W,
and H, respectively.
In the rest of this section, we first discuss the challenges
and our main contributions. Our passive and active
localization schemes are then described in sequence,
followed by discussion on accuracy improvement for our
active localization.

3.1 Challenges and Contributions
The basic idea of localization in RFID systems is to employ
reference points to help determine the position of the target.
For example, to locate an RFID reader, reference tags must
be deployed in the system. Based on the responses from
them, the coordinates of the reader can be derived.
Earlier work [6], [11], [20] is mostly built upon simplified
system models. For example, the wireless signal propagation is usually assumed ideal, such that the RFID reader can
communicate with any tag within a perfect sphere centered
at the reader and with a radius equal to its standard
interrogation range. Such assumptions greatly simplify the
complexity of localization. However, our preliminary
experiments have revealed that they do not hold in a real
environment, leading to challenges summarized below:
.

.

.

Due to the asymmetric antenna gain and multipath
fading, signal transmission from the reader does
not form a perfect sphere (see Fig. 6, for example).
Without this assumption, straightforward geometric
calculation cannot be applied.
It becomes more challenging when the reader
operates near a side/corner or other obstructions,
where only partial and irregular responses from
reference tags can be obtained (as shown in Fig. 11c).
Communication in RFID systems exhibits low
reliability even under static environments. Tags do
not always respond to reader scanning, leading to
unexpected “holes” often observed in our experiments (as depicted in Fig. 11).

3.2 Passive Scheme
The proposed passive scheme aims to locate an RFID tag,
which is attached to the target object, using RFID tags and
readers as reference points with known coordinates. The
Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization scheme is employed
to minimize the error objective functions. Although its
initial setup cost is high due to the need of a set of RFID
readers as reference points, the passive scheme is capable of
localizing multiple targets simultaneously, especially suitable for tracking inexpensive target objects in a small space
for delay-insensitive applications.
3.2.1 Localization System Description
The passive scheme for 3D localization is illustrated in
Fig. 1, where the reference tags with known coordinates are
placed only on the ceiling (or the floor) of the hexahedron.1
1. Note that this is the minimum requirement. One may deploy more
reference tags on other sides of the hexahedron to enhance accuracy.

In addition to the reference tags, Nð 4Þ RFID readers are
deployed on the ceiling (usually at the vertices or edges). As
to be discussed later, deploying more readers may increase
accuracy, but result in a longer computing time and a
higher cost. The passive scheme requires the readers with
multiple transmission power levels. Here, each RFID reader
is assumed to have K transmission power levels, which are
calibrated so that there is a linearly increasing response
range with the increase of power level. The reference tags
and readers are placed appropriately with their accurate
coordinates stored either in the tags and/or readers or in a
database maintained by a local server.

3.2.2 Tag Coordinate Calculation
Upon receiving the request for locating one (or multiple)
RFID tag(s), all readers scan the target tag(s) and report the
gathered information of activated tags to a computer for
coordinate calculation. More specifically, the readers start
with the lowest power level and gradually increase the
transmission power until they receive the response from
the target tag.2 At the same time, each reader also receives
the responses from reference tags. Let k denote the set of
RFID tags which send responses when the reader uses
power level k. Let us consider a reader i and a target tag j.
If j 62 k and j 2 kþ1 , the distance between i and j,
denoted by Lij , can be estimated by averaging the distances
from the reader to all reference tags that are in kþ1 but not
in k . After a set of approximate distances from the target
tag j to the N readers, i.e., L1j , L2j . . . , Lij . . . LNj are
collected, the location of the tag j is determined by
minimizing the error function using the Nelder-Mead
nonlinear optimization, which is defined as

methods (such as binary search) may be employed to improve efficiency.

The Simplex method [16] is used for minimizing the
error objective function " to determine the coordinates of
the target tag j, ðxj ; yj ; zj Þ.

3.3 Active Schemes
In contrast to the passive scheme described above for
determining the RFID tag location, an active scheme is for
locating a reader, with reference to a set of preinstalled
passive RFID tags under a predetermined arbitrary coordinate system. We have pursued an active scheme,
namely the DeB. DeB follows an iteration process to build
a spherical model, which is the best fit of imperfect
responses of the reference tags, such that the sphere center
accurately indicates the target position. DeB is found to
pinpoint a reader in the hexahedron with high accuracy. It
also permits the flexible placement of reference tags.
Moreover, it is RAF, avoiding the need of distance
estimation according to received wireless signal strength
or phase difference at the reader. Therefore, its accuracy is
not materially affected by the types of readers possibly with
different radiation patterns. It does not require multiple
power levels, thus dodging tedious power calibration. The
coordinate calculation is fast, and the system installation
cost is low.
3.3.1 Localization System Description
The localization system, at which our proposed scheme
aims, is illustrated in Fig. 2. A set of reference tags with
known coordinates are placed on two1 or more planes, for
example, on the ceiling and the floor of the hexahedron
(plus the walls to improve accuracy). The placement of
reference tags can be flexible in DeB, not limited to
horizontal planes but virtually anywhere inside the space,
allowing more practical deployment, especially in buildings
with metal frames, which seriously hinder signal propagation for RFID gear.
While both passive and active RFID tags may be
deployed as reference tags, passive ones are chosen due
to their lower costs (except for a large hexahedron, where
active tags are indispensible for required long backscatter
transmissions). Similar to the passive scheme, an arbitrary
local coordinate system is assumed, as shown in Fig. 2. The
reference tags are placed at known spots, with their
coordinates stored either inside the tags themselves or in
a database maintained by a local server. The reader is
located within the hexahedron and has a fixed and suitable
transmission power to activate some of those reference tags.
In addition, backscatter responses emitted from activated

tags are reachable to the reader. As stated earlier, our
scheme does not rely on the signal strength-based radio
range estimation. Thus, it requires neither to fine-tune the
transmission power nor to estimate the distance according
to the received backscatter signal strength, which could
result in considerable inaccuracy.

3.3.2 Overview of DeB
DeB determines directly the spherical model, which is the
best fit of all activated reference tags in 3D. Its basic idea is
to construct an appropriate sphere that partitions the
reference tags into two classes, activated tags inside the
sphere and nonactivated ones outside the sphere. If an
active (or nonactivated) tag falls outside (inside) the sphere
centered at the reader location, the tag is “misclassified,”
because it negatively guides reader location estimation. In a
nutshell, DeB minimizes the total number of misclassified
tags by iterative refinement in the 3D space. During an
iteration, the coordinates and the radius of the sphere are
rectified progressively. The refinement process repeats until
the misclassification degree is below a preset threshold,
yielding the estimated x, y, and z coordinates of the reader.
Unlike earlier NeM (which involves separate passes for
computing the x and y coordinates on each 2D plane and for
computing the z coordinate, with fewer reference tags
involved during each 2D optimization phase [23]), DeB
follows one single pass to compute all x, y, and z
coordinates at the same time for higher accuracy, as will
be demonstrated in Section 4. Additionally, as the reference
tags are not read reliably, NeM calls for preprocessing tag
responses so as to fill in holes (i.e., the nonactivated tags
surrounded by activated tags, possibly due to false negative
responses) before coordinate calculation starts [23]. By
contrast, DeB requires no fill-in preprocess and is more
flexible in reference tag deployment, allowing the reference
tags to be placed over arbitrary planes (as opposed to only
the ceiling and the floor planes under NeM).
3.3.3 Coordinates Calculation
The top view of reference tags and the sphere are illustrated
in Fig. 3. The solid rectangle indicates the area of reference
tags inside the hexahedron. The solid circle is the top view
of a sphere that models the RFID reader coverage area. The
entire space is divided into grid cells. The label inside a cell
indicates its status (see Fig. 3), while the area outside
the hexahedron is filled with empty cells including no
reference tags. The cells with (or without) activated
reference tags are marked as “1” (or “1”). DeB follows
an iterative process to lower the total distances from all

1451

Y -axis, respectively.

misclassified reference tags to the current sphere surface
progressively. This process can be done by considering
the distances between the misclassified reference tags
outside and inside the sphere, i.e., false positive reference
tags and false negative reference tags. The former are
activated reference tags outside the modeled sphere and
have the positive distance values, whereas the latter are
those nonactivated ones inside the modeled sphere and
have the negative distance values (see Fig. 5). DeB aims to
minimize the distance difference due to these two types of
misclassified tags.
DeB starts with the initial values of x, y, z, and radius r,
which are all obtained from the histogram of activated
reference tags in each axis. As shown in Fig. 4, the histograms
dictate the initial values of x, y, and z according to

where npx , npy , and npz are the numbers of grid positions on

(or fiy or fiz ) is the number of activated reference tags from
all planes at the i position on the X (or Y or Z) axis and Nat
is the total number of activated reference tags inside the
hexahedron. For example, the initial coordinates of (x, y) in
Fig. 4 are (4.49, 3.18). The initial z value can be derived in a
similar way. In Fig. 2, if there are 10 (or 20) activated
reference tags on the lower plane, i.e., z ¼ 0 (or the upper
plane, i.e., z ¼ H), the initial z value is then given by
(10x0 þ 20HÞ=ð10 þ 20Þ ¼ 0:67H. Note that while initial
values of x, y, and z can be obtained by different
expressions, those derived following (3) will guarantee
convergence quickly. The initial value of r is derived by the
following equation:

where xmax (or xmin ) is the maximum (or minimum) x
value among all activated tags, and ymax , ymin , zmax , and zmin
are defined similarly. The initial derived values are usually
inaccurate due to those challenges outlined in Section 3.1,
calling for an iterative procedure to refine them progressively. Refinement is guided by misclassified reference tags
with respect to the current sphere. In Fig 5a, the two big
circles (with z equal to 0 and 17) depict the intersection of
the current sphere (before any refinement) with the floor
and the ceiling, respectively. There exist misclassified tags.
For example, the small filled circles indicate activated tags

essence behind (6) is as follows: If the distance from a
misclassified tag (Ti ) to SCj1 is larger than Srj1 , Ti is a false
positive tag that should be included in the sphere, requiring
that the refined sphere center SCj be moved toward Ti , and
Srj1 be enlarged to include the tag. In contrast, if the
distance is smaller, Ti is false negative one, signifying that
SCj should be moved away from the tag, with Srj1 shrunk to
exclude the tag. Accordingly, ij1 in (5) serves as the weight
due to Ti , which has a bigger impact on rectification if

The radius adjustment process in (7) follows a similar step:

refinement process for S j repeats until it converges
(i.e., when jNfj j is smaller than a predetermined threshold).
This is found to be swift, typically taking only a few
iterations, as will be shown in Section 5.

3.4 Accuracy Improvement for DeB
The accuracy of DeB depends on two factors. First, it is
affected by the density of reference tags. Low density tends
to result in coarse granularity and high errors. To achieve
high accuracy, a large number of reference tags should be
deployed. The state-of-the-art RFID technology can effectively deal with the collision problem under very high tag
density. In general, more reference tags yield better
accuracy, naturally with a higher cost at the same time.
Second, as stated in Section 3.1, signal propagation from the
RFID reader does not form a sphere, due to varying signal
attenuation amounts and different antenna gains in
different directions. To study this problem quantitatively,
we define a parameter, dubbed degree of irregularity (DOI).
Given an upper bound (Ru ) and a lower bound (Rl ) of the
reader’s signal transmission range, DOI signifies the
maximum variation of the reader’s transmission range per
unit degree change. For example, Fig. 6a shows the
transmission range of a reader with DOI ¼ 0:03 (in two
dimensions). The inner circle is the lower bound, while the
outer circle is the upper bound of the interrogation range.
The irregular curve between them illustrates the actual
transmission range of the reader over 360 degree. Clearly,
DOI has a negative impact on accuracy. A larger DOI
results in a more deformed circle specified by the activated
reference tags, and accordingly lower accuracy.
While it is difficult to perfectly compensate the irregular
antenna gains and path losses in different directions, a
low-cost antenna array with multiple radiation elements
may be employed to minimize the effect of DOI. (Note that

MANEESILP ET AL.: RFID SUPPORT FOR ACCURATE 3D LOCALIZATION

a current RFID reader may support multiple antennas; for
example, each Alien Technology’s ALR-9900 reader employed in our testbed has four antenna connectors [2].) The
calculation of coordinates is based on all reference tags
activated by the antenna array.
Figs. 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, and 6f show the superimposed
transmission range of an antenna array with 2, 4, 8, 16, and
32 radiation elements, respectively, where Ru ¼ 1:2 units,
Rl ¼ 0:8 unit, and DOI ¼ 0:03. Clearly, more radiation
elements result in a set of activated tags closer to a perfect
circle and accordingly more accurate results, at the expense
of an increased hardware cost. We also employ an
“optimized method,” with calculation based only on the
set of nodes which are activated by all radiation elements, to
more effectively filter out irregularity. Our simulation
results of the aforementioned approach for accuracy
improvement are provided in the next section.
Particular challenges arise when the reader moves near a
wall or a corner of a hexahedron-shaped space, due not
only to abundant interrogated signals being reflected from
the walls, but also to the absence of tags outside the space.
As a result, those situations yield severely distorted shapes
of activated reference tags, considerably hampering the
accuracy of reader localization based on only those
activated tags alone. To this end, an enhancement method
has been developed for improving location estimation,
aiming to account for those missing tags which otherwise
are present if they were placed outside the room when the
walls were nonexisting, known as the Enhanced DeB
(EDeB). Compensated tags are virtual ones employed for
helping define a less deformed sphere to arrive at better
localization. The compensated tags together with those
activated tags inside the room are used for computing the
target location. EDeB is also applicable to situations where
large objects (e.g., metal shelves) exist to block signals from
the RFID reader to certain reference tags.
The way to obtain those virtual (i.e., compensated) tags
starts with estimating the center position of activated tags on
a given plane (be the floor or the ceiling) using DeB following
(3)-(7), denoted by (xc ; yc ). The estimated center (xc ; yc ) then
serves as the reference origin of a Cartesian coordinate
system, called CC , whose X0 -axis and Y 0 -axis are in parallel,
respectively, to the original X-axis and Y -axis of the plane, as
shown in Fig. 7. Clearly, CC separates activated tags into
four quadrants, assuming that xc 6¼ 0 and yc 6¼ 0. For
example, each activated tag at (xi ; yi ) in the fourth quadrant
(e.g., a, b, or c), a virtual tag is obtained at location (xv ; yv ) in
the second quadrant (e.g., a0 , b0 , or c0 ), satisfying
xv ¼ xi cosðÞ  yi sinðÞ
yv ¼ xi sinðÞ  yi cosðÞ:

ð8Þ

According to (8), virtual tags (xv ; yv ) outside the room are
derived from activated tags (xi ; yi ) in each quadrant by
rotating  to aid in pinpointing the target. As discuss earlier,
the target reader is located at the point marked by a star
(“$”). Those virtual tags derived using (8) are denoted by the
solid square, “ ,” in Fig. 7, where the new (xc ; yc ), denoted by
the triangle “,” is seen to be closer to the center of the set of
activated tags plus virtual tags than that of the set of
activated tags alone. Note that EDeB is applicable for

1453

Fig. 7. The compensation process.

improving localization accuracy, provided that the target
object is not located on a side wall (or at a corner). When the
target is moved away from any wall (toward the room
center), fewer virtual tags result, as the set of activated tags
then define a better circle, calling for fewer compensated
tags. In practice, the compensation process is invoked only if
the target is close to a side wall, a situation which can be
easily identified by examining the number of activated tags
in the row (or column) just next to a wall; it is closer to the
wall if the number is larger, and the compensation process is
invoked when the number exceeds a threshold, say 2. Given
the compensation process aims to rectify the set of tags
involved in a target localization, the process may repeat after
a refined center (x1c , y1c ) is obtained, by viewing the new
center as (xc , yc ) and following (3)-(8) to get a new center
(x2c ,y2c ) in the second rectification. This compensation process
finishes when the distance between (xic ,yic ) in the ith iteration
and (xciþ1 ,yiþ1
c ) is smaller than a predetermined threshold. It
is found that this refinement usually completes after a few
iterations (say, 3 or less). In essence, EDeB relies on two
accuracy improvement techniques: 1) reader rotation (to
emulate an antenna array with k radiation elements, by
rotating 360 degree/k in each step) to deal with DOI and
2) tag compensation to deal with “wall adversary.” Experimental results of EDeB will be demonstrated in Section 5.2.

SIMULATION RESULTS

We carry out extensive simulations by using Matlab [12]
and Java codes to evaluate our proposed 3D RFID
positioning schemes. In particular, we study the impact of
several parameters of interest, such as the radio propagation irregularity, the number of radiation elements of the
antenna array, and the reference node density, which may
dictate the accuracy of our passive and active schemes. We
have simulated a hexahedron of the size of a typical
container (about 400  80  80 ).

4.1 Passive Scheme
As we have discussed in Section 3.2, a set of reference tags
and readers need to be deployed on the floor or the ceiling
of the hexahedron for the passive scheme. In our simulation, N ¼ 12 readers are deployed by default. The density of

1454

NO. 7, JULY 2013

Fig. 8. Simulation results under the passive scheme.

the reference tags is represented by a parameter , which is
the distance between two adjacent reference tags, with 
equal to 1 ft by default. Each reader has K transmission
power levels with a maximum transmission range of 16 feet.
We assume the transmission power levels are calibrated so
that there is a linearly increasing response range with the
increase of power level, to improve the accuracy. In other
words, the transmission range per power level is 16/K feet.
We vary the values of N, , and K to observe their impacts
on the accuracy of the passive scheme. The error is defined
as the absolute difference between the actual coordinates of
(x, y, z) and the calculated coordinates of target objects,
(xc ; yc ; zc ), as expressed by
qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Error ¼ ðx  xc Þ2 þ ðy  yc Þ2 þ ðz  zc Þ2 :
The results are the average of 2,560 sample points
distributed uniformly in the hexahedron.
We have observed from our simulation that there is a
tradeoff between the accuracy and the cost in the
implementation of the passive scheme. We first study the
impact of the number of reference readers (N). As can
be seen in Fig. 8a, the errors decrease with more readers
deployed, because more readers result in a more accurate
error objective function (i.e., with more terms in (1)). At the
same time, however, deploying more readers clearly
increases the system cost and leads to a higher computing
complexity and longer time to locate the target.
Besides the number of readers, the number of power
levels (K) available to each reader is usually a dominating
factor on the accuracy of the passive scheme. Our results
show that more accurate coordinates are yielded with
more power levels (see Fig. 8b, with K up to 16). This is
reasonable, because a larger K results in a finer increase in
the readers’ transmission power and, thus, more accurate
estimation of distances from the target tag to the readers.

However, the reader with many power levels is usually
unavailable off-shelf or prohibitively expensive.
Figs. 8c and 8d show the impact of target locations on the
accuracy of the passive scheme. It is observed that
the accuracy of x and y is insensitive to the location of the
target. The errors vary only marginally with the location. At
the same time, the error of z is not affected much by the
location when the target is below 5 feet. While the target
becomes very close to the ceiling, the error of z increases
significantly because the relative error becomes high.
In addition, we observe that the density of reference tags
has less impact on accuracy compared with N and K (see
Fig. 8e). This is because the density of the reference tags is
often sufficiently high, leading to a much finer granularity,
compared with the readers’ transmission power levels. In
particular,  does not noticeably affect accuracy when
  16=K, because, with the reference tag density so high,
the power level granularity completely dominates the errors.

4.2 Active Scheme
To employ the proposed localization scheme, a set of
reference tags are placed at known coordinates on the floor
and the ceiling of the hexahedron. Similar to the simulations
for the passive scheme, the density of the reference tags is
represented by , which equals 1 foot. The target RFID
reader is located inside the hexahedron and has a fixed
transmission power, which results in Ru ¼ 7:2 ft and Rl ¼
4:8 ft (i.e., the upper and the lower bounds of reader’s
transmission range). The default value of DOI is 0.03. The
results are based on an antenna with four (4) radiation
elements, unless specified otherwise.
To characterize DeB accuracy, we compare the simulation results of DeB with those of NeM in all three different
approaches for selecting reference tags: SCM, IBM, and
FBM [23]. In addition, the “optimized” scheme discussed in

MANEESILP ET AL.: RFID SUPPORT FOR ACCURATE 3D LOCALIZATION

1455

Fig. 9. Simulation results under DeB and NeM active schemes.

Section 3.4 was incorporated to effectively utilize all
radiation elements for compensating DOI, on top of DeB
and of NeM with the FBM. We vary , DOI, and the
number of elements k to observe their impacts on the
accuracy under DeB and under NeM. The impact of DOI on
accuracy for  ¼ 1:0 ft is depicted in Fig. 9a, where the
errors are seen to increase monotonically with DOI, because
higher DOI results in a more deformed sphere (under DeB)
or circle (under NeM) of the activated reference tags and
accordingly larger errors in finding the target coordinates.
NeM (with optimized FBM) is more accurate than other
NeM methods, able to locate the target with errors less than
0.5 ft even when DOI is high. NeM (with SCM), on the other
hand, results in the largest error, because it is heavily
affected by the partial circles when the target is near a
hexahedron side or corner. As expected, DeB (which is
“optimized,” i.e., its calculation is based only on the set of
nodes that are activated by all k radiation elements)
achieves the best accuracy and is robust to the increase of
DOI, because it handles all misclassified reference tags by
3D optimization effectively.
Employing more radiation elements can effectively
reduce the negative impact of DOI, as illustrated in
Fig. 9b, where the results of DeB and NeM (with optimized
FBM) under various numbers of radiation elements are
shown. The errors are the largest under one antenna
(i.e., k ¼ 1), and they are reduced sharply when the antenna
array deployed has two and four radiation elements. More
radiation elements yield smaller errors, because those
activated tags better construct a sphere, thereby yielding
more accurate target coordinates. DeB outperforms NeM
consistantly for any given k.

The density of the reference tags () also affects achievable accuracy. As also demonstrated in Fig. 9c, a higher
density (i.e., smaller ) tends to result in smaller errors.
When  becomes  1 ft, however, it has an insignificant
impact on the accuracy of any scheme. This is because, for
  1 ft, the density of reference tags is no longer a
dominating factor, as the errors are then introduced mainly
by DOI. Clearly, DeB outperforms NeM for any , achieving
an error of some 0.2 ft only for  ¼ 1:0 ft, in comparison to
more than 0.3 ft under the best NeM, i.e., NeM (with
optimized FBM). In addition, the gap widens as  grows.
The execution times (in ms) of location identification
schemes versus the number of involved reference tags (n)
are depicted in Fig. 9d, where the density of the reference
tags () is fixed at 1.0 ft and n includes all activated tags
plus all nonactivated tags located within the reader antenna
range. When the number of involved tags (n) rises, the
execution time grows accordingly for every identification
scheme, as expected. The proposed DeB scheme enjoys the
time complexity of O(n) in the presence of n involved tags,
exhibiting far smaller execution times when compared with
the earlier NeM counterpart (which requires two rounds of
2D optimization on the ceiling and the floor planes
separately, followed by z coordinate calculation [23]). Given
n ¼ 1;600, for example, DeB run on a laptop takes only
83 ms, in contrast to some 400 ms (ignoring the time for
preprocessing activated tags) under NeM, as illustrated in
Fig. 9d. It should be noted that the number of involved
reference tags (n) depends solely on the reader antenna
range and the tag density (), irrespective of the total
number of tags deployed or the hexahedron size. The

1456

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS,

proposed DeB smartly outperforms NeM in both identification accuracy and speed, suitable for real-time applications.
Figs. 9e and 9f show the errors of DeB at various
locations in the hexahedron. The highest accuracy is
observed when the target is at the center of the hexahedron,
i.e., x ¼ 20 and y ¼ 4 for z ¼ 4, where the coordinate error
approaches 0.2 ft. When the target RFID reader moves
closer to a hexahedron corner, the errors grow monotonically because the circles or spheres formed by those
activated reference tags suffer from more distortion. This
calls for an enhancement method to deal with those
situations with pronounced localization inaccuracy, and
such a method will be detailed in the next section.
In addition to its fast localization and high accuracy, the
proposed DeB scheme is readily applicable in practice
because it employs only passive tags, whose price may soon
drop to several cents apiece. Currently, the passive tags
adopted for our experimental study (i.e., the Alien Squiggle
tags) cost less than 15¢/each (for a roll of 10,000 at
$1,488.00). The DeB identification time for a huge room
(say, sized 99 ft by 49 ft by H, where H is the reader antenna
range) with 10,000 deployed tags remains no more than
83 ms as long as n  1;600 (see Fig. 9d). Consequently, a
DeB-based RFID positioning system can be established with
a fairly low cost while achieving high reader localization of
any place inside a 3D hexahedron.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

5.1 Experimental Setup
To further investigate the effectiveness of our proposed
3D positioning schemes, we have conducted experiments
by using the Alien RFID kits [1], [2], including an ALR-9900
RFID reader and ALN-9540 Squiggle tags. Our experiments
were done in the realistic environment of 16 ft long, 14 ft
wide, and 17 ft high. The ALR-9900 reader connects via the
TCP/IP port, on which basic web-based utility software is
run to control the reader (e.g., to find a suitable transmission power level) and the Java program is run to obtain the
results (e.g., to acquire the ID of responding tags), needed
for our 3D positioning schemes. A circularly polarized
antenna is attached to the reader, which supports up to four
antennas. A photo of our experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 10, where the white box is a reader’s antenna attached
to the red box, which is an RFID reader. The reference tags
are the small rectangles placed on the middle of each
square ceiling board. We carried out experiments using
ALN-9540 tags and ALR-9900 reader attached with an
antenna, as mention earlier. Given that the reader’s antenna
has coverage area far beyond the room under its regular
transmission power, our experiments lowered the antenna’s transmission power to -15 dbm so as to ensure that
some parts of the sphere surface are located inside the
target room.
Without loss of generality, an arbitrary coordinate
system is assumed, with its origin at the reader’s antenna
in each experimental setup. The reference tags are put at
grid points across the ceiling and on the floor, with the
distance between two adjacent grid points equal to 1 ft, as
depicted in Fig. 11. In the figure, an activated tag is denoted
by a small circle with a solid center, and those on the floor
are easier to be visualized (than those on the ceiling), with

the actual reader position denoted by a star and the
calculated reader locations according to DeB and NeM
schemes marked under each situation.
As described in Section 3.4, the reader antenna suffers
from DOI, which can be mitigated using the antenna array.
Without a suitable antenna array at hand, we emulated the
effect of an antenna array (with k radiation elements) via
rotating the reader antenna k times each by (360/k) degree
during every experiment to suppress DOI. A larger k tends
to yields a better shaped sphere those activated tags, thus
higher accuracy in locating the target object.

5.2 Experimental Results and Discussion
Six sets of experimental data are presented in Fig. 11 for
evaluating the accuracy of DeB and NeM, under various
target positions and different k values. More specifically, we
have carried out experiments when the target reader antenna
is situated at the center (with x ¼ 8:5, y ¼ 7:5, z ¼ 8:5), close
to a sidewall (with x ¼ 8:5, y ¼ 4:0, z ¼ 8:5) and to a corner
(with x ¼ 4:0, y ¼ 10:0, z ¼ 8:5) of the room. We vary k to be 1
and 4. When k ¼ 4, the reader’s antenna was rotated by
90 degree for four times, and those activated tags with
respect to each antenna orientation were aggregated together
for computing the reader location. This process can also be
done in one step without rotation by using four antenna
arrays as discuss in Section 3.4 to collect the tag information
at once. In Fig. 11, the target reader is located at the point
marked by a star (“$”), whereas the calculated positions
under DeB (or NeM) is denoted by “” (or “þ”).
If the target reader is moved toward a corner or a
sidewall of the room, computed coordinates exhibit higher
errors due mainly to fewer tags being activated because no
tags are outside the room, and also to rising interferences
caused by heavier reflection from the walls, as stated earlier
and confirmed in Figs. 11c, 11d, 11e, and 11f. To deal with
this “wall adversary,” EDeB was introduced in Section 3.4

to enhance the accuracy through a compensation process
which accounts for those “missing” tags outside the room.
Experimental results under EDeB are also illustrated in
Fig. 11, as marked by “u
t”. When the reader is situated in the
room center with k ¼ 1, DeB scheme works to locate the
target accurately, as illustrated in Fig. 11a, exhibiting an
error of 0.76 ft (which is better than 0.98 ft under NeM).

Utilizing the accumulated tag responses after k ¼ 4 rotations (each by 90 degree), both DeB and NeM improve
coordinate accuracy, as shown in Fig 11b. Specifically, the
error then stands at 0.07 ft under DeB to enjoy 91 percent
improvement over k ¼ 1, whereas the error drops to 0.47 ft
under NeM. In this case, DeB is far more accurate than its
NeM counterpart.

1458

Fig. 12. RD (i.e., A shown in Fig. 5b in ft) from (5) versus number of
iterations under DeB.

When the reader is moved toward a side of the room, the
accuracy of DeB deteriorates, as demonstrated in Figs. 11c
and 11d. In addition, the benefit from an antenna array (of
k ¼ 4) drops, with the calculated errors equal to 0.45 ft
under k ¼ 4. On the other hand, EDeB brings down the
error to roughly 0.3 ft for both k ¼ 1 and k ¼ 4, as denoted
by “u
t”. Apparently, tag compensation is more effective in
accuracy improvement in this situation, as expected,
because it is aimed to handle “wall adversary.” The
localization errors rise noticeably when the reader is moved
toward a corner of the room, as depicted in Figs. 11e and
11f, with the errors approaching 2.2 ft to 2.7 ft even for k ¼ 4
under both DeB and NeM. These large errors are due to
severe “wall advisory,” which has to be dealt with using tag
compensation. Indeed, EDeB boosts localization accuracy
significantly, giving rise to errors below 0.4 ft (representing
accuracy improvement more than 80 percent) under both
k ¼ 1 and k ¼ 4, as demonstrated in Figs. 11e and 11f. Given
error amounts are comparable under k ¼ 1 and k ¼ 4,
reader rotation offers limited alleviation for wall advisory,
and tag compensation is indispensable. The tag compensation process repeats to arrive at more accurate target
coordinates progressively. Progressive iterations are found
to lower refined distance (RD) monotonically, as depicted
in Fig. 12, where RD refers to as the sum of the distance
between each misclassified tag and the surface of the
defined sphere calculated from (5).
Misclassified tags fall into two categories: the false
positive and false negative activated tags, with the former
(or the latter) ones yielding positive (or negative) distance
values in calculating RD. According to the curves in
Fig. 12, the RDs, or “A” shown in Fig. 5b under DeB,
decrease quickly, and they drop to negligible amounts in a
few iterations, for all of our experimental scenarios
considered. The computation times taken by this compensation process are small, involving some 20 ms (or 40 ms)
only if the target is at the center (or near a wall), when
executed on a Dell Optiplex GX745 desktop machine with
Core2 CPU @2.40 GHz and 3 GB of memory.
Localization error versus the number of iterations under
EDeB is illustrated in Fig. 13. Four scenarios are included in
the figure, including the target located close to a wall and to
a corner with k ¼ 1 and k ¼ 4. Tag compensation lowers the
computed errors effectively, greatly enhancing localization
accuracy. Under the worst scenario considered (for the

target near a corner with k ¼ 1), tag compensation is shown
to bring the error down to about 0.4 ft in eight iterations,
resulting in accuracy improvement of some 86 percent.

CONCLUSION

We have considered and contrasted two RFID-based 3D
localization schemes, namely, the passive scheme and the
active scheme aiming to locate a target object in 3D space.
Both schemes are RAF (i.e., distance estimation based on
signal strength is not require), thus exhibiting accuracy
levels independent of reader types (with varying radiation
patterns). In the passive scheme, we locate an RFID tag,
which is attached to the target object using RFID tags and
readers as the reference points. Under the active scheme, we
propose the DeB scheme for inexpensively and quickly
locating either a mobile person or robot who wears an RFID
reader or an object approached by an RFID reader in a
3D space. Deemed the very first RAF 3D localization
without involving other devices or sensors in support of
high accuracy, the active scheme employs a set of RFID tags
with known locations as references to pinpoint a reader
operating in one fixed power level as the target object.
We have carried out analyses, extensive simulations, and
testbed experiments to evaluate the proposed schemes
under various system parameters, including the DOI, the
number of radiation elements of the antenna array, and the
reference tag density. Our results show that both schemes
are effective, with active schemes outperform the passive
one. They also demonstrate that the proposed active scheme
(DeB) clearly prevails over its earlier counterpart (i.e., NeM
[23]) in both identification accuracy and speed, suitable for
real-time applications. Furthermore, EDeB is developed for
accuracy improvement, often locating an RFID reader
dramatically better, in particular when it is close to a side
or corner of a 3D hexahedron.
