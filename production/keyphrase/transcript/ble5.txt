(i.e., interrelating several targets among each other), from selfreferencing to cross-referencing (i.e., other users requesting a
user’s location), and from content-oriented to application-oriented

ABSTRACT
Location is considered as the most important and relevant context
information. Bluetooth technology, being a common feature of
commercial mobile devices, is a (or the) key technology that is
pervasively available nowadays. There has been not much success
in using Bluetooth technology for indoor localization, mainly due
to the limitation of the technology. Using the Context
Management Frame (CMF) infrastructure deployed in our office
building, we have designed, implemented and evaluated a
Bluetooth based indoor localization solution that determines the
locations of stationary mobile users at a room level. The solution
is based on the inquiry response rate of Bluetooth technology.
This approach does not require establishing any connectivity
between Bluetooth devices. Further, since the solution is
infrastructure- and network-based, it does not require mobile
devices to be upgraded in any way in order to be localized. The
results of experiments show that our solution has 98% accuracy in
rooms with full Bluetooth sensor coverage, when the target device
being stationary for 3 minutes.

Location determination is the main component of the systems that
deliver LBSs. For outdoor environments Global Positioning
System (GPS) provides an effective solution to determine location
of GPS enabled mobile devices. For indoor environments,
however, such an effective solution does not exist. As a result,
indoor location determination is an active area of research
nowadays. In this contribution we consider an indoor localization
solution that relies on Bluetooth technology that, being a common
feature of mobile devices, is a pervasive technology currently.
Most Bluetooth based solutions rely on network characteristics
like Received Signal Strength (RSS). Bluetooth RSS, specified as
RSS Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality (LQ), is not a reliable
measure considering the heterogeneity of Bluetooth hardware in
available devices. This is partly resulting from an imprecise
definition of RSS in the Bluetooth standard [2]. Obtaining
Bluetooth RSS, moreover, generally requires establishing
connectivity between corresponding devices. This requires users
to maintain their devices in connectable mode, which is
considered unsafe by most users.

General Terms

Our location determination method is a fingerprint-based
localization solution that relies on only the Response Rate (RR) of
Bluetooth inquiries. This just requires mobile devices to be in
discoverable mode. According to this approach, every location is
fingerprinted by Inquiry RRs (IRRs) of Bluetooth sensors
installed in a multi-floor building. After obtaining the IRR of a
target device to be localized, our system uses relative entropy
measure (i.e., Kullback-Leibler function) and its extension (i.e.,
Jensen-Shannon distance measure) to estimate the location of the
target device. We evaluated the performance of the solution by
carrying out some experiments in an infrastructure deployed in
our entire office building. The accuracy of our location estimation
is almost 98% in a room where all neighboring rooms have
Bluetooth dongles. Note that this performance was obtained when
different device types were used for the fingerprinting of rooms,
and the target device to be localized differed from those devices
used for room fingerprinting. During our experiments, moreover,
the target device was relocated in the test room every hour. Our
solution aims at determining location at a room level, which is a
meaningful granularity for a wide range of indoor applications.
Moreover, our approach does not require any upgrade to mobile

1. INTRODUCTION
Location based Services (LBSs) have resurrected in recent years
due to several important developments like emergence of GPScapable mobile devices, introduction of Web 2.0 platform, and
deployment of wireless broadband wireless services [1]. There are
also a number of paradigm shifts that have contributed to
resurgence of LBSs, namely: from reactive to proactive (i.e.,

infrastructures (i.e., preferably require no upgrade of user
terminals, need no excessive hardware installation, and use
existing technologies), impose low power consumption on mobile
terminals, and use low cost infrastructure [6]. As mentioned in
[6], Zigbee and Bluetooth are two technologies that impose low
power consumption on mobile terminals. It is, however, Bluetooth
technology that has been deployed pervasively nowadays and it is
considered to be “the fastest growing technology since the
Internet or the cellular phone”, see pp. xiii [7]. Having no mobile
terminal upgrade has guided us to adopt an infrastructure-based
and network-based approach, as categorized in [2]. In such an
approach a target device to be localized must be in discoverable
mode and almost all of localization process is delegated to
Bluetooth infrastructure (i.e., to Bluetooth access points and the
backend server, as described in detail in Section 3).

devices to be localized and it inflicts low power consumption on
mobile devices due to its reliance on Bluetooth technology.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives
some background information over existing localization
approaches and our Bluetooth based solution. Section 3 describes
our solution in detail. Section 4 provides the results of our
evaluation of the proposed solution. Finally Section 5 presents our
conclusions and future research directions.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Localization Approaches
Localization systems can be divided into two categories:
processing based and fingerprint based. Processing based systems
use techniques like lateration, angulation, dead reckoning and
proximity detection, see [2] for references. For example, the
famous GPS uses lateration and angulation techniques to derive
the coordinates (i.e., position) of GPS devices. These techniques
process different parameters of radio signals like RSS, angle of
arrival, time of arrival, and time difference of arrival. Processing
based systems generally rely on dedicated software/hardware and
they are not much effective indoors. Indoor environments affect
the propagation of wireless signals non-deterministically due to
sever multi-path effects, dead-spots, noise and interference [3]. As
a result, it becomes infeasible to construct a simple and accurate
model of indoor signal propagation which is required for the
techniques mentioned.

2.3 Challenge and Opportunity
The process of establishing connectivity between two Bluetooth
devices relies on inquiry and paging mechanisms. The inquiry
mechanism allows the inquirer to discover the Bluetooth enabled
devices in its neighborhood. The inquirer transmits a series of
inquiry packets and the discoverable Bluetooth device, which
periodically scans for inquiries, eventually replies with a
Frequency Hop Synchronization (FHS) packet. The FHS packet
contains all information that the inquirer needs to establish a
Bluetooth connection with the scanning device (e.g., device class
and type). Then, the paging mechanism is used to find out the
services that a target device provides. To this end, the inquirer
pages the target device using information obtained during inquiry.
If the target device scans for paging, it replies. Subsequently a
connection is established between the two devices and the
inquirer retrieves information about the services provided by the
target device. After this the connection is generally shut down.
Using the information obtained during paging, the inquirer
establishes another connection towards the target device with
appropriate quality of service requirements.

Fingerprint based systems capture fingerprints of all known
locations. These fingerprints are (pre-recorded) measurements of
network characteristics in the corresponding locations and they
can be considered as signatures of those locations. For
localization of a target device, the momentary network
characteristics of that device are examined with respect to the
radio map (i.e., collection of location fingerprints) and most likely
location is determined. The network characteristics used for
fingerprinting include RSS, access point ID, and RR. A taxonomy
of fingerprint based approaches is presented in [2].

Scanning devices can choose for two modes: discoverable and
connectable. Being in discoverable mode is enough for the
inquiry mechanism. For establishing connectivity, however,
scanning devices must choose for connectable mode which
implies also being discoverable. The user acceptance barrier to
maintain devices in discoverable mode is lower than it is for
connectable mode. Therefore, we require for target devices (i.e.,
those to be localized) to be just discoverable.

RR is one of the network characteristic that is not well-explored
for fingerprinting. It is defined as “the frequency of received
measurements over time from a given base station” in [2] or “the
percentage of times that a given access point was heard in all of
the WiFi scans at a specific distance from that access point” in
[4]. RR approaches proposed so far are used in combination with
RSS for localization with WiFi technology [3][4] and with
Bluetooth technology [5]. In this paper we design and evaluate a
fingerprint method that relies on only IRR fingerprints of
Bluetooth technology.

Our approach uses inquiry response rate as the sole network
characteristic to fingerprint locations and localize target devices.
Every TS = 10 seconds Bluetooth access points (i.e., the inquirers
called “dongles” from now on) obtain a list of discovered “object
devices”. The Bluetooth IRR is defined as “the percentage of
inquiry responses to total inquiries, replied by a discoverable
target device and sent by a dongle that are located at a specific
distance from each other”.

2.2 Motivation and Principles
Our work is motivated by the design of a location based
application called “Colleague Radar” that locates coworkers in
our office building. The application aims at locating users at
room-level where users are assumed to be stationary for a while
(e.g., the person being in her/his room or in a meeting room for a
few minutes or more). This means that tracking users (in realtime) is not required for the application.

Many fingerprinting solutions are based on RSS and access point
ID. Recent findings indicate that RSS should be used as a weak
indicator of distance for indoors [4]. Cheng et al [4] explored WiFi RR as a new metric for location estimation and found out that
there is a strong relation between distance and RR, compare
Figures 2 and 3 in [4]. We investigated the relation of IRR and
distance for Bluetooth in our office. Our test was carried out in

On the other hand, successful and widely deployable indoor
localization systems must integrate smoothly with existing

The system distinguishes between different types of Bluetooth
devices: dongles and mobile devices. Bluetooth dongles are the
inquiring sensors that are plugged in to the PCs of users. Since
these machines have a fixed location (only desktop PCs were
used), the locations of these dongles are known. Mobile devices
are being discovered by the inquiring dongles, and can be further
distinguished into two categories: reference devices and target
devices. Reference devices are mobile devices for which the
location is known a-priori, since they are known to have been at a
particular location at a particular point in time. Target devices are
devices for which there is no a-priori location information. It is
the task of the Bluetooth positioning system to estimate the
location of the target devices by comparing their observed
fingerprints with the (pre-recorded) fingerprints of the reference
devices. Little homogeneity exists among the Bluetooth mobile
devices, while the dongles are all of the same type.

three locations: a room with a dongle, the hall outside the dongle
room and a room across the hall. All IRR measurements were
carried out at points 2 meters apart on a straight line. Both walls
between the rooms and the hall were thin, however, there was a
wide metal bookshelf behind the wall between the hall and the
room across the hall. Table 1 summarizes the test results and
shows how IRR decreases with increasing distance. Each row of
Table 1 reports the average and variance of IRR measurements
measured every 5 seconds for 20 minutes (thus 240 samples),
where every IRR sample is the RR of the last 50 inquiries.

The Bluetooth localization system architecture is shown in Figure
1 schematically. This architecture encompasses the main system
components in the central machine and does not include dongles
connected to remote PCs. As shown in
Figure 1, room
fingerprints are derived during training and (pre)stored in a
database. On the other hand, the location fingerprint of a target
device is detected in real-time and fed to a location estimator that
compares it with room fingerprints one by one. The best match
determines the location estimate of the target device. This
estimate is fed to the Colleague Radar application. Our system
determines user locations when the users are stationary for a few
minutes. If the target device moves between rooms, our location
determination system does not give any particular location as an
output, however a subcomponent indicates that the user is
moving. This subcomponent is out of scope of this paper.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work that bases its
location estimation process solely on the IRR parameter. We
adopted an IRR based approach for two reasons: (i) RSS in
Bluetooth (e.g., RSSI or LQ) cannot be obtained reliably due to
the fact that power aspects are not standardized in detail [2]; and
(ii) obtaining RRS in Bluetooth v1.1, based on which our dongles
were manufactured, requires establishing connectivity between
devices, an operation that is against our requirements.
An IRR based approach faces the challenge of a target device
being detected by many Bluetooth dongles of the surrounding
rooms. In the rest of paper we propose a method that eliminates
the location uncertainty imposed by the IRRs of multiple
Bluetooth dongles.

3.1 Infrastructure and System

3.2 Solution

Our Bluetooth positioning system was implemented on top of an
existing Context Management Framework (CMF). The CMF is a
publish-subscribe system where remote machines run so-called
context-sources which publish contextual information to central
machines that have subscribed to that type of context information.
The location determination takes place in a central component
called location estimator that subscribes to all Bluetooth contextsources. Bluetooth context-sources run inquiries periodically, and
send the results of these inquiries to their subscriber as soon as an
inquiry has completed. An inquiry result is a list of Bluetooth
addresses that were discovered by every Bluetooth context source.
In our setting, inquiries have a fixed length of 5.12s, and are
started every TS=10s.

Let {d1, d2, …, dM} denote the set of the dongles installed on
users’ PCs. We assume these PCs are located at topological
locations (i.e., rooms) of the building, generally one in every
room. This constitutes a dynamic sensor network connected
through Ethernet. Dynamicity comes from the fact that users’ PCs
can come and go as users log in and log out their systems.
Fingerprints indicate the spatial density of Bluetooth cells in each
room in that, given a room, (a) which subset of dongles detect a
discoverable mobile device in the room; and (b) how often they
discover the device. These are a function of RSS, the geometry of
the building, etc. We have two fingerprint types: training

Let {ik1, ik2, …, ikM} be the number of times that in a training
window of WT seconds dongles {d1, d2, …, dM} have detected the
reference device of Room k. Further, let nT be number of inquiry
done by these dongles in WT seconds (note that all dongles
inquiry at a fix rate of every TS=10 seconds, thus nT given WT is
independent of k). Then, the training fingerprint Tk is defined as a
vector:

4. EVALUATION
To evaluate the performance of our solution we conducted two
tests in two rooms of size 4m×6m in our office building. These
rooms are called Room-1 and Room-2 from now on. Our office
building has 4 floors and each floor has about 20 rooms. Room-1
was located in floor 2 and surrounded by rooms all with dongles
(i.e., rooms on the right, left, top, and below had Bluetooth
dongles). Room-2, on the other hand, was located in floor 3 and
surrounded by rooms with and without dongles (i.e., rooms on the
right and below had no Bluetooth dongles). We refer to Room-1
and Room-2 as rooms with full and partial coverage, respectively.

In each room we put a target device in 6 positions, for about one
hour in each position. These positions were at least one meter
apart and considered to be the most likely user locations (i.e., of
room residences and visitors). The test rooms as well as all the
surrounding rooms (12 and 14 rooms in total) were fingerprinted
for the duration of the test. These fingerprints were obtained using
dedicated reference devices that were (a) other than the target
device and (b) of 4 different types: Bluelon BT-002 body tags,
HTC-P3300 and 9000 and Nokia E61 and N70.

p ( x)
q( x)

The KL divergence or relative entropy has the following
interpretation: if a source produces symbols x according to
distribution p(x), then a data compression scheme that uses p(x) to
compress a sequence of such symbols will result in optimum
entropy rate H ( p ) = − ∑ p ( x ) log p ( x ) bits per symbol on
x

We carried out location estimations every 5 seconds for the target
device in Room-1 or Room-2, using KL and JS divergence
measures. The estimation performance is evaluated based on
estimation accuracy that is defined as the percentage of times in
which a method gives the correct location estimate with respect to
total number of estimations. The estimation accuracy can be
determined for the most likely estimate and for 2 most likely
estimates (i.e., that either of the rank 1 or rank 2 estimate is
correct) and so on. We refer to these accuracy measures as top-1
or top-2 accuracy, respectively.

average. If the data compression scheme uses another distribution
q(x) instead of p(x) to compress the same sequence, then the
result will have D(p||q) bits more on average. Note that KL
divergence is not a “distance” measure in that D(p||q) ∫ D(q||p).
Our approach approximates the location of the target device with
the location of the closest room. The output of such a localization
process must have minimum deviation or distortion from the real
room where the user is physically. The physical/real location is
characterized by L, thus our location estimate is Room-k such that
D(L||Tk) is minimized, or:

In Figure 2 two graphs (1st and 3rd from top) show the top-1
accuracy of the KL scheme for the test in Room-1, given two
training window sizes of 5 and 30 minutes (i.e., WT=5’ and 30’)
and as a function of localization window size WL. The training
fingerprints for the graphs of Figure 2 were obtained in the
beginning of the test day. For WL ¥ 2’, the accuracy of the KL
method is almost 100%.

m =1

where M = 0.5( L + Tk ) . Note that, unlike KL divergence, JS
divergence is a distance measure in that JSD(p||q) = JSD(q||p) [6].

The location estimation component in Figure 1 determines the
location of the target device by finding the room fingerprint that
best resembles the observed location fingerprint. This can be
considered as a classification problem. The difference measure
used in our system is based on the concept of information gain,
calculated using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For two
probability mass functions p(x) and q(x), KL divergence is
defined as:

x

∑(n

JSD( L || Tk ) =

let {j1, j2, …, jM} be the number of times that in a localization
window of WL seconds dongles {d1, d2, …, dM} have detected a
target device. Then, assuming the same inquiry rate nT, the
location fingerprint L is defines as:

D ( p ( x) || q ( x)) = ∑ p ( x) log

M

Because in practice we determine location fingerprints using
rather small training and localization window sizes (i.e., WT and
WL), it is possible for some dongles to miss the replies of
reference or target devices. This causes the KL measure to deviate
enormously. Therefore we have adopted its modified version
called Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence [6], defined as:

Each element Tkm of Tk, m=1, …, M, can be considered as an
empirical binary distribution with parameter ikm nT . Similarly,

L = ( L1 , L2 ,..., LM ) = (

M

∑ D( L

D( L || Tk ) =

k

To calculate KLk, we assume independence between the binary
random variables corresponding to the outputs of dongles given
the location of a target device. Then,

The KL method, however, is sensitive to training data and partial
dongle coverage, for example, its accuracy becomes about 7783% if we use a different training data set in each hour or it

WL=3’ and WT=10’. For both tests, the accuracy of top-2 estimate
is 100%.

becomes about 14-45% if we do estimation in Room-2 with
partial coverage. Therefore we adopted the JS method whose
performance is shown by two graphs (2nd and 4th from top) in
Figure 2 for the same training set. As can be seen from Figure 2,
the accuracy of JS is slightly lower than that of KL.

In all graphs mentioned so far (i.e., all graphs in Figure 2, Figure
3 and two bottom graphs of Figure 4), we have used two different
devices as a reference device to collect training data and as a
target data to collect localization data in each room. In our
experiments, moreover, the target device was moved every hour
with respect to the reference device. If, in addition to training
data, we used the rest of the data collected from the reference
device for localizing the same reference device –the approach
commonly used in literature e.g. [8] – then we would have a top-1
estimate accuracy of almost 100%. Such performance indications
are shown by top 2 graphs in Figure 4 for the JS method. Using
the same device for training and localization is often not realistic;
therefore, we have chosen to present our results based on a
realistic case where training and localization devices differ.
Should in practice training and localization device be the same,
our JS based scheme achieves 100% accuracy of top-1 estimate
for both full and partial coverage even if WT=5’ and WL=1.5’.

In this paper we proposed a Bluetooth based localization solution
that works well when there is a high spatial density of Bluetooth
sensors. This means that it is suitable for multi-floor buildings
with overlapping Bluetooth cells. The solution is a fingerprinting
approach that exploits the inquiry response rate of Bluetooth
technology. As such the solution does not require any upgrade of
mobile devices and only requires these devices to be in
discoverable mode. The solution was implemented and tested.
The test results showed that the solution achieves top-1 estimation
accuracy of 98% and 75% when there was full sensor coverage
and partial sensor coverage, respectively. For this performance,
the training and localization window sizes were 3 and 10 minutes,
respectively (i.e., WL=3’ and WT=10’).

For the JS method, the effect of partial Bluetooth dongle coverage

accuracy for a localization window size of 3 minutes (i.e., WL=3’)
as a function of training window size WT. The bottom two graphs
of Figure 4 show the results of the top-1 estimate for duration of
260 minutes for the tests in Room-1 and Room-2 with full and
partial coverage, respectively. For these graphs the training
periods are chosen in the beginning of each test day, and the data
obtained in the rest of each day is used for location estimation of
the target device. As we observe, the accuracy of the JS method
for top-1 estimate in Room-1 and Room-2 is 97.82% and 75% for

Currently we are working on a number of issues and extensions.
The impacts of interference and mobility on the RR are needed to
be further studied and ways to deal with a time-variant RR are to
be investigated. One approach hereto is to obtain and use fresh
fingerprints. This solution direction, however, makes sense if one
devises localization methods that work well with short
fingerprints. The current approach of fingerprinting locations by

53

using dedicated reference devices, moreover, is infeasible when
the number of locations is high. A better approach would be to
automatically obtain these fingerprints. We are currently
investigating whether the dongles used to record the fingerprints
can be used as reference devices as well. This basically involves
devising a control mechanism (i.e., control protocol and logic)
that switches dongles between two modes: a mode where they are
inquiring and one where they are discoverable.

Dongles compatible with Bluetooth v1.2 standard are able to
provide also the RSS of inquiry responses. It is important to
investigate how much our scheme is improved if also the RSS
information of Bluetooth inquiries is used for location
determination. Another interesting extension to examine further is
to fuse the Bluetooth sensor information with other types of
sensor data. Since our infrastructure (i.e., CMF) is providing
contextual information from multiple sources, combining these
sources could aid the location determination. Should this
combination allow the system to accurately determine the location
of a target device, then the observed fingerprint of the target
device could be used as a room fingerprint and added for the
already existing fingerprints for that room.

An interesting direction is to get some more insight into the
impact of our approach on the mobile phones in terms of power
consumption. The power consumption of a mobile device being
inquired continuously will increase as the frequency of inquiries
or the number of inquirers increases. On the other hand, a higher
number of inquirers or a higher inquiry frequency will yield a
more responsive system and possibly better (more accurate)
fingerprints. An interesting research question is how the
estimation accuracy relates to the power consumption of the
mobile devices.
