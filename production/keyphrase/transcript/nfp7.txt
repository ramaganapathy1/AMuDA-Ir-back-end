Abstract— Autonomous localization of nodes in wireless sensor
networks is essential to minimize the complex self organization task consequently enhancing the overall network lifetime.
Recently, precise indoor localization is impeded by multi path
propagation of signals due to reflections at walls or objects.
In this paper we partly overcome some of these problems by
methods like frequency diversity and averaging multiple measured data. Received radio signal strength (RSS) in combination
with weighted centroid localization, featuring low communication
overhead and a low complexity of O(n), is our basis of a
localization on the energy constrained sensor nodes. We first
analyze the RSS-characteristics on a specific sensor node platform
in different rooms. Next, we describe methods to improve these
characteristics to reach best localization results at minimized
complexity. Finally, in a practice indoor localization we achieve a
small localization error of only 14% for 69% of all test-points that
was enhanced to at least 8% in average by simple optimizations.
For that, no hardware modifications as well as time consuming
RSSI-maps or complex signal propagation models are required.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Hundreds of tiny electronic devices, able to sense the environment,
compute simple tasks and communicate with each other, form a
huge wireless sensor networks (WSN). Gathered information (e.g.
temperature, humidity etc.) is transmitted in a multi hop fashion
over direct neighbors to a data sink, where the data is interpreted
[1]. With methods like self configuration and self organization the
network reacts to node failures. Wireless Sensor Networks enable
new possibilities for timely detection of wood fire, monitoring of
artificial dikes along a river, and “Precision Farming”. Due to the
desired nodes size of only some millimeters, the dimensions of the
communication module and the battery are critical. Consequently,
the scarcest resource within a network is the available energy [2].
Therefore, achieving a long lifetime of the sensor network requires
low power hardware and algorithms. Beside the measuring task every
sensor node must be able to forward packets and to compute different
subtasks like CRC-checking or data aggregation.
This paper briefly analyzes an approximate indoor localization with
a weighted centroid approach combined with signal strength measurements. We partially overcome some of the problems resulting by
indoor signal propagation. Our approach achieves a good precision
without the need of time consuming creation of RSSI-maps or
complex probability models.
This paper is subdivided as follows. In Section II, we give a
basic overview about the methods for localization in wireless sensor
networks. Then a more detailed description about common methods
in indoor localization follows. We continue explaining the “Weighted
Centroid Localization” algorithm (WCL) in Section III. Next, in
Section IV, the received signal strength characteristic of our used

hardware-platform is analyzed and optimized. Followed by an adjustment of WCL, we continue showing the results of our practical
indoor localization in Section V. After a detailed discussion of them
in Section VI we finally conclude the paper in Section VII.

II. L OCALIZATION IN S ENSOR N ETWORKS
After deploying the sensor network over an area of interest,
initially the sensor nodes have no position information. For several
reasons a node’s position is very important:
• Measurements without a location where they were gathered are
generally useless.
• Full covered sensor networks enable energy aware geographic
routing.
• Self configuration and self organization are key mechanisms for
robustness and can easily be supported by position information.
• In many applications the position itself is the information of
interest.
At present a mobile device can be tracked outdoor and limited
indoor by the “Global Positioning System” (GPS). However, this
system requires line of sight to some satellites, consumes additional
energy and is too expensive to get integrated on hundreds of energy
constrained sensor nodes. For this reason a small number of existing
localization methods assume that some sensor nodes already know
their own position. These nodes are called beacons or anchors. All
other nodes in the network, without known positions, are further
called unknowns. With known distances and/or angles between
beacons and unknowns, the localization process starts. We classify
algorithms into exact and approximate methods for localization.

A. Exact Localization
Exact localization of an unknown features high precision and is
based on solving a linear system of equations with coordinates of
the beacons and distances to them. With at least three beacons,
required in 2-dimensions, unknown nodes estimate their positions via
trilateration. More beacons than required result in an over determined
system of equations that must be solved with e.g. a least-squares
method (multilateration). Due to complex and memory consuming
calculations, exact methods are not suited to run on resource and
energy constrained sensor nodes [3]. Nevertheless, Savvides et al.
describe different approaches (Atomic, Iterative, Collaborative Trilateration) for exact or also called fine-grained localization in wireless
sensor networks [4].

B. Approximative Localization
Considering energy constraints in sensor networks created the
group of approximate algorithms that consumes less power but
estimates a position with a higher localization error. Different approximate (also called coarse grained) localization approaches exist
in the literature.
Tian et al. completely avoid distances in their approach [5]. First,
triangles are combined with all beacon coordinates in the field. Then
every unknown checks by a ”point in triangulation-test” (PIT-test) on

which triangle surface it is. In this PIT-test only neighbor relations are
used. A following intersection test with all filtered triangles shrinks
the region where the unknown is probably located.
In another approach by Bulusu et al. every unknown maintains a list
with all beacons in transmission range. The beacons are deployed on a
grid of points with same distances to each other [6]. With all received
positions sent by the beacons, unknowns calculate the centroid as
its own position. Further approaches introduce constraints [7] or a
relative coordinate system [8].

C. Measuring Observations
With only few exceptions localization methods require observations to deduce distances from. These observations are gathered
by different measuring techniques like e.g. time of flight, received
signal strength, and differences of the phase. Signals can be either
radio, infrared [9] or ultra sound [10]. Reading the received signal
strength indicator (RSSI) is supported by almost every transceiverhardware that makes this to a beneficial solution. Transmitted signals
are attenuated in the communication channel between sender and
receiver. Thus, the RSSI determined by the receiver is lower then
the emitted signal by the sender. This dependency can be described
among other models with the log-normal-shadowing model:
RSSI(d) = PT − P L(d0 ) − 10η log10

Unfortunately, the received signal strength measurements are
highly error-prone due to the following reasons:
• Reflections of radio waves at obstacles cause multi path propagation.
• Other electrical fields in the environment interfere the transmitted radio waves.
• The resolution of the received signal strength indicator can be
limited by the transceiver hardware.
• The required line of sight between nodes can not be guaranteed.
• Node mobility influences the measurement.

D. Indoor Localization with Received Signal Strength
1) Problem Statement: The described multi path effect leads,
especially indoor, to high measurement errors. Reflections of electromagnetic waves at walls, objects or persons produce high fluctuations
of the received signal strength. There exist different methods to
reduce these errors.
First, high redundant measuring is one of the basic procedures to
eliminate outliers. Second, there are two possibilities to reduce errors
caused by reflections - antenna diversity or frequency diversity.
Antenna diversity means using two antennas that are placed 1/2

wavelength apart. Because the extension of the “null” in space is
restricted to a fraction of the wavelength, the probability for two
nulls 1/2 a wavelength apart are very small. The receiver must switch
between both antennas and use the one that at any time measures the
strongest signal.
Frequency diversity means that the message is transmitted at two
different frequencies separately. If there is a destructive interference at
one frequency, it is not very likely that it will be destructive also at the
other one. For the reason, that our used hardware platform supports
two frequencies, we will gather information for two frequencies.
2) Related Work: Zhou et al. analyzed the effects of signal
propagation in indoor environments and described different techniques to reduce the error [11]. Furthermore, Elnahraway et al.
tested different algorithms for localization in a typical IEEE 802.11
network infrastructure with RSSI [12]. One of the most well known
localization systems with signal strength in literature is RADAR [13].
A very comprehensive overview about different localizations systems
gave Lymberopoulos et al. in [15].
Two approaches are commonly accepted in literature - RSSI-maps
and Signal Propagation Models. Many RSSI-measurements at different locations in a building form a so called RSSI-map which is
stored on a node or on a base station [14], [16], [17]. An unknown
estimating its position compares the measured RSSI-values with the
entries in the RSSI-map. The position with the most equal entry is
then chosen. Although the precision of this technique is relatively
high, movements of objects or persons enforce a recreation of the
map, which is very time consuming.
As an alternative the Signal Propagation Models have been established [12], [18], [19]. The effects of indoor signal propagation are
mapped in numerous propagation models. The measured RSSI by the
unknown is transformed by a formula to a corresponding distance.
Advantageously, the complex premeasurement is not needed, but the
mapping of a real environment to a model is very difficult and not
always appropriate. Approaches with self learning algorithms enhance
classical Propagation Models and increase the overall precision
[21]. However, these models require complex calculations on the
unknown node. In our approach, we neither use RSSI-maps nor
Propagation Models. We first analyze the RSSI-characteristics for our
specific hardware at different locations. Then, we reduce the locationdependent errors and adapt the curves to WCL.

III. BACKGROUND : W EIGHTED C ENTROID L OCALIZATION
The following reasons motivated us to choose WCL as the algorithm for indoor localization [3]:
•
•
•

Low memory allocation.
Low complexity O(n) allows distributed computation on every
sensor node.
High input errors (e.g. defective RSSI or beacon coordinates)
slightly decrease the precision.

Further, we describe the procedure of WCL. In order to do so, we
define some variables. A sensor network with a total number of k
nodes consists of u sensor nodes and b beacon nodes (b  u).
Beacons are equipped with more efficient hardware and a localization
system (e.g. GPS), whereby they are able to determine their own
position. If the positions cannot be determined via GPS, which is in
indoor scenarios more realistically, we deploy the beacons at known
positions in the building. The algorithm is divided into two phases.

A. Initialization Phase
In the first phase, all beacons broadcast their position Bj (x, y) to
all unknown sensor nodes within their transmission range. Ideally, the
transmission range is small enough to reach many unknowns. While
receiving the packets, every unknown measures the received signal
strength and stores it together with the position of the beacon.

B. Distributed Computation Phase
After all positions are gathered, the unknown estimates its approximate position P (xiapp , yiapp ) by a weighted centroid determination
for all n positions of the beacons in transmission range:

The weighted centroid determination considering distances
di1 ...di4 results in the approximated position Pi (xiapp , yiapp ). Figure
2 shows that distance di1 is higher weighted than di4 and significantly more weighted than distances di2 and di3 . Consequently, the
approximated Position moves considerable to B1 ,B4 and slightly to
B2 ,B3 as well as to the exact position Pi (xexact , yexact ) and thus
the estimation error fi (x, y) decreases.
We postulated that distances are attained by observation values. Due
to interferences, obstacles, and hardware restrictions, the obtained
distances are very noisy. Hence, WCL uses distance information
as a weight wij . Small distances to neighboring beacons lead to
a higher weight than to remote beacons. Further, every coordinate
of a beacon’s position obtains a weight depending on the distance
wij (dij ). The calculation of a weight by an RSSI-value and their
optimization is described detailed in Section IV-A.2.
The localization error fi (x, y) is defined as distance between exact position Pi (xexact , yexact ) and approximated position
Pi (xapp , yapp ) of sensor node i:



fi (x, y) =

(xexact − xapp )2 + (yexact − yapp )2

Figure 2 shows the exact Pi (xexact , yexact ) and the approximated
Pi (xiapp , yiapp ) position of a sensor node determined by a weighted
centroid calculation with positions of four beacons B1 ...B4 . In different publications we analyzed the adjustment of the most important
parameters in a multi hop case [21].

IV. E VALUATION
This section describes extensive analyzes of the signal strength
characteristics of a sensor node platform in different environments in
order to use RSSI as input for a Weighted Centroid Localization.

A. Hardware Platform
1) Chipcon CC1010 Sensor Node Platform: As node platform we used modules of the type CC1010 (868/915MHz) from
Chipcon. These modules feature low power consumption and a low
transceiver sensitivity of typically -107dBm. The integrated 8051micro-controller allows simple calculations and the control of the
transceiver hardware. We attempted to reduce transmitter/receiver
variability and different antenna characteristics using the same standard antenna on every module. The evaluation modules (CC1010EM)
supported revision 3.0 and the evaluation boards (CC1010EB) revision 4.0. We encapsulated the CC1010EM circuits in a chassis with
additional modules and batteries to allow free movement (see Figure
3).
2) Send Power Levels: The transceiver allows configuration of
different output powers, by writing to the “Output Power Control
Register” (P A P OW = 0xE2). A table with the relation between
the register values and their corresponding output powers is given
below 1 .

position because of the higher weight wij in the calculation process.

3) Received Signal Strength Indicator: The evaluation module features measurement of the received signal strength in form of
an RSSI within the interval −50dBm ≤ RSSI ≤ −110dBm.
The RSSI is determined by an analogue digital converter which
converts the measured voltage over a 27kΩ resistor (50dB/V) which
is in the interval 0V ≤ RSSI ≤ 1.2V . We investigated that the
sensor modules do not depend on the input voltage that makes the
localization process more robust.
4) Frequency Switching: The Chipcon modules feature a
simple frequency switching by software between 868.28MHz and
915.03MHz. We gathered sample data for both frequencies under the
same test conditions.
1 Higher output power (> −5dBm) is supported by the hardware but
produced no additional information in our test scenarios. The RSSI always
reached its maximum at -50dBm.

B. Analyzing and Optimizing RSSI-Measurements
To get an idea of the RSSI characteristics, we first gathered sample
data in different measurement series. For that purpose, we mounted
5 evaluation modules on the evaluation boards. Every node was
given a specific identification number2 (ID). In all test setups node
ID 94 represents the unknown and node ID’s 63,77,78,89 represent
the beacons. First of all, we measured the RSSI on a straight line
at different distances. To be able to detect location dependencies,
we measured in 2 different rooms with different floor materials and
objects within. The modules were placed on the ground, that was
made of carpet (room 1) and linoleum (room 2). Both rooms had a
size of 7 × 5 meters. The measurement process at every distance step
consists of RSSI-data:
• at 2 frequencies (868MHz, 915MHz),
• with 15 different output send powers,
• and 30 repetitions to calculate mean and standard deviation.
The results for 2 beacons (sender) and always the same unknown
(receiver) are illustrated 3 in the Figures 4 and 5. Every figure shows
2 The ID originates from the last two numerics of the explicit hardware
identification number.
3 It is important to annotate that the standard deviation of all curves is
marginal and was left out in the figures. Moreover, we connected the resulting
RSSI samples to a line, which is indeed mathematically not correct, because
every point is only a snapshot of the curve. Both changes shall improve the
viewers perspective.

different RSSI-boundaries.

the obtained RSSI-curves over the distance at 15 power levels. The
characteristics approximately correlate with the expected signal path
loss curves to be obtained by (1). An increasing output power level
at the sender results in an increasing RSSI-value at the receiver.
Reflections in the room produce high outliers e.g. in Figure 4 at
250cm or in Figure 5 at 200cm. The outliers do not vary at the
different power levels.
The measured data scatter in a specific probability interval. The
scattering depends among others on the already introduced influences.
To determine the “best” value out of the stochastic values within the
measurement interval there exist different operators for averaging.

We decided to calculate the arithmetic mean in (4) to obtain
the optimal RSSI-value per distance. The standard deviation as an
indicator for the quality of a measurement was not considered at
present, because we do not need this value in the localization process.
After averaging the curves for both frequencies, we derived 8 RSSIcurves. To illustrate, Figure 6 shows the averaged curves for beacon

averaging process, described in Section IV-C, the unknown estimated
its position via WCL.
In further simulations we tried to enhance the precision by introducing RSSI-boundaries. The reason for that is the insufficient
differentiation after 200cm in room 2. Thus, all RSSI-values above
a specific boundary were set to zero. There exist 52 RSSI-values in
the test scenario, arising from the corresponding distances from 13
test-points to 4 beacons. Summarized, the RSSI-value between a testpoint and a beacon that is above the boundary indicator-value was
not considered in the localization process. The boundary ranged in
simulations between 10 and 25.

77. Although the outliers still exists, averaging both curves (for
868MHz and 915MHz) yield in more linear curves with less extreme
outliers then before. This method was repeated for all nodes in both
rooms resulting in one characteristic RSSI-curve for every beaconunknown combination (see Figure 8).
Summarized, relations between RSSI and distance are qualified for
localization input in the first room between 1cm and 350cm and in
the second room between 1cm and 200cm. A differentiation of the
RSSI after these distances is almost impossible.
Recapitulating, the defective RSSI-characteristics were enhanced
by gathering more measurements and a simple averaging. So far,
no hardware modification or complex computations were required.
Following, we consider the findings for a transformation of the RSSI
as weight in WCL.

C. Adjustment of the weight in WCL
In [3] we described an optimal weight for exact and for defective
distances. Now, we want to convert the RSSI-values into a weight
by starting to convert the original scale4 ranging from -110dBm to
-50dBm into a standardized scale5 ranging from 1 to 61:
RSSIstand (d) = −RSSI(d) + 49

(5)

The weight wij (d) must be inversely proportional to the standardized RSSI-value because closer beacons to an unknown must have a
higher weight then farther ones. In [21] we introduced a degree q to
additionally vary the weights.

RSSI q

VI. D ISCUSSION
The experimental test setup basically showed the efficient function
of WCL in an indoor environment. Higher degrees ”pulled” the
unknowns too close to the beacons with short distances. On the other
hand, if the degree was too small (e.g. q = 1), the estimated position
moved in the centroid.
A significant enhancement of the localization was reached by involving boundaries. This originated by the heavy defective RSSI-values
after 200cm (Figure 8). The optimal configuration of all parameters,
where the localization error reached its minimum, was determined
at RSSIbound = 19 and degree q = 1. At this point most of the
RSSI-values in the localization process are accurate. It was shown in

D. Realization of an Indoor Localization
In the previous sections we defined the basics for a practice indoor
localization. Next, the initial test setup will be described. Our test
field was quadratic with side length w = 300cm and build up in
room 2. The sensor nodes were placed on the ground consisting of
linoleum. Some furniture (tables, chairs) stood next to the walls. The
four beacons (ID = 63, 77, 78, 89) were placed at the four corners
of the field with the positions B63 (1, 1); B77 (300, 1); B78 (1, 300);
and B89 (300, 300). The unknown node (ID = 93) was placed at 13
different positions (see Figure 10). At every position the unknown run
the measuring process described in Section IV-A.2 (2 frequencies, 15
power levels, 30 RSS-indicators) for all 4 beacons. Followed by the
4 The

Over degree q > 3 the relative localization error rised nearly
linear. The localization error varied between 7.8% ≤ f ≤ 26% at
different degrees ranging from 1 to 3 (Figure 7). The RSSI-boundaries
influenced the characteristics of the curves for q < 3 very strongly
and controlled the number of RSSI-values used in the localization.
Figure 9 illustrates the number of RSSI-values used in the localization
process, the minimal relative localization error, and the optimal
degrees over different RSSI boundaries. At a very low boundary,
RSSIbound = 12, less than 15 out of 52 RSSI-values were involved
in the localization. With an increasing boundary an increasing number
of RSSI-values got involved. At RSSIbound = 19 and degree q = 1
the minimal relative localization error of f = 7.9% was achieved.
This optimal configuration used the half of all possible RSSI-values.
At RSSIbound = 20 the error reached its maximum. At the end
of the curve, RSSIbound > 25, all RSSI-values got involved in
the localization and so the error stayed constant at f = 14.009%
(f = 14.7851%) at a degree of q = 2 (q = 3). Whereas a degree
of q = 1 dominated at lower boundaries, at higher boundaries the
degree q = 2 dominated.

value -110dBm represents a long distance between sender and
receiver, complementary the value -50dBm means a small distance.

was achieved for 69.23% of all test-points without optimization.
Additionally, the enhancement with boundaries decreased the relative
average error to at least f = 7.9%. The resulting error field is
shown in Figure 10. The error can be decreased with more beacons.
Especially one beacon in the centroid is very effective, because it can
reach almost all unknowns under the 200cm boundary. Further, the
neighboring unknowns can interchange RSSI-values to detect outliers.

VII. C ONCLUSION
We showed in this paper that the approximate ”Weighted Centroid
Localization”-algorithm in combination with received signal strength
achieved in indoor environments a small localization error of 14%
for 69% of all test-points. With optimization the averaged error was
decreased to only 8%. This result was obtained without the need
of time and memory consuming RSSI-maps or probability models.
We first analyzed the characteristic RSSI-curves for different indoor
environments for 2 different frequencies (868MHz, 915MHz). Then,
we reduced the location dependent errors and introduced a boundary
under which the sampled data was qualified for localization. The
WCL-algorithm features a low complexity of O(n). Hence, WCL can
be computed on energy constrained sensor node without exploiting
them.
