Environmental-Adaptive RSSI-Based
Indoor Localization
Hyo-Sung Ahn and Wonpil Yu

Abstract—This paper addresses a novel method for localizing a stationary object in an indoor office environment. The proposed method
utilizes the received-signal-strength index (RSSI) of radio signals radiating
from fixed reference nodes and reference tags placed at known positions
to generate a precise signal propagation model. Signal attenuation parameters are updated online according to environmental variation; thus, the
proposed method has environmental-adaptation capabilities. Subsequent
experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over a commercial location-based service (LBS) chipset.
Note to Practitioners—The practical motivation of this paper is summarized as follows. First, we would like to develop an indoor wireless localization network that is particularly useful for the position estimation of
stationary and/or slowly moving objects. The sensor network developed in
this paper can be variously used for factory automation, home automation,
robot navigation/guidance, and pedestrian tracking. Second, the environmental-adaptive RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL) algorithm developed in this paper is based on received signal strength; so the system is very
simple and the implementation cost is much cheaper than typical TOA and
TDOA-based methods.
Index Terms—Indoor localization, location-based service (LBS), received-signal-strength index (RSSI), wireless sensor network.

I. INTRODUCTION

O

NE OF THE key issues in mobile robot applications is to locate
persons and assets placed and possibly moving around a mobile
robot [1]. In actual applications, it is often difficult to locate pedestrians
or stationary objects because the mobile robot is not able to identify
them using typical vision or laser scanner sensors. Specifically, even
though the mobile robot can recognize the shapes of pedestrians and
objects based on image processing techniques, it has a limited capability to identify them if they are similar. Thus, in the field of mobile
robotics, concepts such as intelligent space (iSpace) [2], ambient intelligence [3], [4] and ubiquitous robotic space (URS) [1], [5], [6], [8]
have been recently proposed in attempts to enhance the capability of a
robot in identifying objects and humans. In these concepts, the primary
idea is that by attaching a reference tag, the robot is able to easily identify and locate the human or object by detecting the tag. As addressed in
[6], [7], wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies are considered a

promising tool for achieving this aim. To this end, it is shown here that
WSN-based indoor localization is one of the most important research
topics in the field of intelligent robotics.
It should be noted that there are still a number of challenges to be
overcome in the field of WSN-based localization. The main difficulty
lies in the fact that communication signals in an indoor office environment face interference and attenuation from multi-path, reflection,
channel fading, deflection, and diffraction. In fact, it is quite difficult to
establish a reliable signal propagation model in an office environment
due to difficulties in reliably estimating the signal path-loss parameters (i.e., signal attenuation parameters). As such, this paper addresses
a novel method for estimating the signal path-loss parameter in an indoor office environment.
In the field of WSN-based indoor localization, there has been a considerable amount of research; for a comprehensive overview, refer to
[9] and the references therein. The state-of-the-art technologies in this
field are typically based on ultra wideband (UWB; IEEE 802.15.4a)
[10], [11] and ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4). However, though UWB-based
technologies provide reliable positioning information; their installation
cost is quite high [8]. Thus, Chipcon (http://www.chipcon.com) commercialized a localization network system (cc2431) based on ZigBee
as an alternative to UWB. The Chipcon (cc2431) chipset uses the received-signal-strength to evaluate the distance between reference nodes
and tags; however, this method has no capability to adapt to environmental variations as it needs an accurate signal propagation model,
tuned in advance by the user.
In this paper, the received-signal-strength index (RSSI) is used to
calculate the distances between tags and reference nodes. In the proposed approach, the signal propagation model and model parameters
are updated online in a closed-loop feedback correction manner. The
novel contribution of this method, though a very simple idea, is to evaluate signal attenuation parameters using reference tags at each sampling time to compute other tags’ unknown positions, thereby enabling
adaptation to environmental variation.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, an environmentaladaptive RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL) technique is established. The actual hardware platform and experimental test results are
then briefly addressed in Section III, and conclusions will be given in
Section IV.
II. ENVIRONMENTAL-ADAPTIVE RSSI-BASED
INDOOR LOCALIZATION (EARIL)
This section addresses a new localization method based on RSSI that
is particularly beneficial for indoor asset tracking. The newly-proposed
method has the ability to adapt to environment variations; thus, it is referred to here as an environmental-adaptive RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL). Recently, RSSI-based localizations have attracted considerable attention due to their simplicity and low cost [12], as well as
their lower sensitivity to bandwidth and occurrences of undetected-direct paths [13]. RSSI-based methods compute the distance between a
sender and a receiver using the signal-strength received and a relationship between the signal-loss and the propagation distance. The following
signal propagation model has been widely used for this relationship
I (r ) =

c
I (0)
ra

(1)

where I (r) represents the signal-strength measured at distance r; c is a
proportional constant, I (0) is the signal-strength at a unit distance, and

a is the attenuation parameter of the signal propagation. Traditional
RSSI approaches aim to calculate the unknown distance r using the
measurement I (r) and parameters a; c, and I (0) modeled in advance.
Thus, in traditional approaches, the distance r is simply calculated with
the fixed parameters a; c, and I (0) as
r=e

:

(2)

In actual applications, however, traditional approaches may not be efficient and potentially result in numerous errors because the parameters
a; c, and I (0) are environmental-dependent in the presence of signal
interference, deflection, variation of the power radiating from the transmitter, and other complex radio characteristics. The motivation of this
research is thus to establish a scheme that is tolerant to parameter variations arising from the shift of environmental characteristics. To this
end, the new RSSI-based method proposed consists of reference nodes
that receive and send radio signals, and a tag that computes its position
using a radio propagation model that is updated in real time based on
the received-signal-strength.
Before outlining the algorithms let us first examine the relationships
among the parameters of (1). Assuming c is fixed, let us suppose that
there are parameter variations in a and I (0) such as a0 = a + a and
I 0 (0) = I (0) + I (0), which change (1) to

c
I 0 (r) = a+a (I (0) + I (0)):
r

(3)

This relationship states that if there is a variation in magnitudes of the
attenuation parameters and initial signal-strength, the received-signalstrength at the distance r changes from I (r) to I 0 (r). In other words, if
the model parameters change, the received-signal-strength would be affected; in such case, if the fixed parameters a and I (0) are used without
modification, the distance will be evaluated as

illustrates three reference nodes, the number of reference nodes and
tags can generally be extended to N .
From (1), we need to estimate model parameters a and c based on
the received-signal-strengths. For convenience, let us say that the reference node i transmits the radio signal with a strength of ci and
receives the signal of the reference node j with a strength of cji ; the
tag receives the signal from i with a strength of ciT . Here, the distance between i and the tag is denoted as ri , and signal attenuation
parameter is ai . Then, the unknown parameters are ri ; ci , and ai , and
their corresponding measurements are cji and ciT ; the problem is to
determine ri by estimating ai and ci based on the measurements cji
and ciT .
A simple solution for this parameter estimation is to use the known
distance between i and j ; i 6= j . That is, since the reference nodes
are fixed at known points, and ci and cj are related by the equation

Therefore, if parameter variations are not considered, then distance errors of r 0 r0 = r 0 r1+a=a (I (0)=(I (0) + I (0)))1=a = r[1 0
ra=a (I (0)=(I (0) + I (0)))1=a ] will certainly exist. That is, the actual distance is still r even though the signal characteristics have been
changed (i.e., from a to a + a and from I (0) to I (0) + I (0)), but the
estimated distance is r0 . As such, it is essential to update the model parameters in such a way that the calculated position properly reflects the
variation of environmental characteristics. Note that c is a constant, so
we can simply consider cI (0) as the initially-radiated signal-strength;
in the following section, c = 1 can thus be used without notational
confusion.
A. Localization Using Fixed Reference Nodes
The concept of localization using fixed reference nodes (LFRN) is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this figure, the tag measures the received-signalstrength and calculates the distance between the reference nodes and
the tag; the tag is attached to a tracked target, and the reference nodes
are placed at known points. The reference node is composed of transmitter and receiver, and the receiver computes model parameters based
on the received signal-strengths, which are sent from other reference
nodes. Also shown in the figure, the radio signal radiating from the
transmitter in a reference node is received by the receivers in other reference nodes as well as by the tag. Note that though this figure only

if cj is known. However, as cj is environmental- and time-dependent,
cj should be measured or estimated beforehand. To this end, one simple
idea is to measure the initially radiated-signal-strength, as depicted in
Fig. 1. That is, cj is measured by the receiver of the reference node j .
Another method is to use two different reference nodes to estimate cj
as well as aj . Here, let us suppose that the reference nodes i and
k ; i 6= j; i 6= k; k 6= j , measure the signal of the reference node
j with strengths cji and cjk respectively. Then, in addition to (5), we
have an additional signal-strength relationship

The overall procedure is summarized as follows. The receivers, placed
within the reference nodes, and the tags receive signals radiating from
the transmitters of individual reference nodes. After that, the reference
nodes send information including measured-signal-strengths to the tag
using a wireless local area network; the tag then estimates aj using (8)
or (9). Next, based on (1), the tag can compute the distances between
the reference nodes and the tag as
ri

= (ci=Ii )1=a :

(10)

Using (10), it is then straightforward to estimate the position of the tag;
a review of these localization algorithms is presented in [14]. In [14], if
the positions of reference nodes are known as (xi ; yi ), then the position
of the tag can be simply computed by

[^x; y^]T = (HT H)01 HT b

and Ki2 = x2i + yi2 .
Thus far, we have presented a localization method using reference
nodes that contain both a transmitter and receiver. The receiver receives radio signals radiating from the transmitter and measures the
signal-strength to calculate the signal attenuation parameter. Note that
the communication load may be heavy in this approach.

where cim is the received-strength of the ith reference node signal (Ni )
at the mobile reference node, rim is the distance between the mobile
reference node and Ni ; ci is the initially radiated signal-strength of Ni ,
and ai is the attenuation parameter of the ith signal. Now, the problem
is to determine the signal attenuation parameter ai and initial signal
strength ci based on cim and rim .
In this approach, since we are using only one mobile reference node,
N
ci cannot be computed in real time. However, if c0 =
i=1 (ci )=N is
used for ci , then ai can be estimated online based on signal measurements. That is, when the relationship given by (13) is shifted by

B. Localization Using Mobile Reference Nodes
The LFRN method of the previous subsection may have a high computational load; however, if the proposed idea is applied to mobile robot
applications, the computational load can be substantially reduced. To
achieve this reduction, the concept of localization using mobile reference nodes (LMRN) is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the robot is seen
tracking a pedestrian (the mobile reference node can be considered a
mobile robot and the tag can be considered a pedestrian). It is relatively
easy to locate the mobile robot using some existing methods [5], [15]
as numerous sensors and other communication equipment can be installed onto the robot.1
Fig. 2 shows that the wireless localization network is composed of a
mobile reference node, fixed reference nodes, and a tag.2 If the reference tag is mounted on a mobile robot, the reference tag has mobility
(referred to as a “mobile reference node”); as the node, its position can
be accurately monitored. This mobile reference node can thus be used
for the computation of attenuation parameters. Here, the signal propagation is governed by the formula

C. Sensitivity Analysis
In this section, we examine the effects of error in the estimated-attenuation parameters and measurement noises. Here, let there be a variation in model parameter a such as a + a; the attenuation parameter was
previously estimated as a + a + . Thus, the actual signal-strength
measured at r will be I 0 (r) = (I (0))=(ra+a ) + n, where n is the
measurement noise, and the distance can be estimated as

and lower errors of r^ can then be established, allowing us to evaluate
the performance of the algorithms developed in the previous subsections. Also, from (27), (29), (30), and (31), it is certain that if a is not
properly estimated, the uncertain boundaries of (33) will be enlarged.
As such, it is notably important to update the propagation parameters
according to environmental variations.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

For the experimental verification of the environmental-adaptive
RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL), we developed a ZigBee
(2.4 GHz RF communication system) sensor network, as shown in
Figs. 4 and 5. The reason we selected the ZigBee communication
system as our hardware platform is twofold: 1) it is very convenient
and cheap to use a ZigBee transceiver as a reference node and 2) we
can easily add motion sensors to the ZigBee system, so that the
tag is able to sense the motion of an object. The developed ZigBee
system switches between two modes: sleep mode and operating mode
according to motion; hence, the battery life of the tag can be extended.

image on the left is the reference node attached to the wall and the
right image is the reference node attached under the ceiling. Fig. 5
shows the reference nodes installed in an office. In this architecture,
each individual mobile reference tag measures the RSSI of the signal
radiating from the fixed-reference transmitters. Then, each mobile
reference tag transmits the data packet to the tag. In the packet, the
last two data are coordinate values in the x and y axes of the tag
calculated by the Chipcon cc2431 chip mounted in the tag. Note
that cc2431 is one of the most widely used commercial products in
indoor localization and has been used to locate a tag based on RSSI as
in the method established in this paper; thus, cc2431 is used here as a
benchmark for a comparative experimental study. In the left plot, the
solid lines (blue) are the calculated x and y of the tag from cc2431; the
dot-dashed lines (red) are the calculated x and y tag coordinates from
LFRN; and the dashed-lines (black) are the actual values. From these
plots, we can see that the proposed method is better in estimating y ,
though cc2431 is better in calculating x. To quantitatively compare the

Thus, it is necessary to place a mobile reference tag that can receive signals
from the fixed reference transmitter beside the fixed-reference transmitter so

fixed reference node in a pair.

performances, we then calculated the total errors of the left plot, with
the results shown on the right. Similarly, Fig. 7 shows the test results
of LFRN when the tag is placed nearby a wall. As shown on the right,
the proposed-method again has a better performance than cc2431.
Fig. 6 illustrates the experimental results of the localization algorithm with fixed reference nodes (LFRN) when the tag is placed inside
the sensor network.
For the experimental test of the localization algorithm with mobile
reference nodes (LMRN), we simply turned off all mobile reference
tags, and placed the reference mobile tag in an open space; this reference tag acts as a mobile reference node. Table I shows the test results,
where the true position is the coordinate of the actual place where the
tag was placed. The position measured from cc2431 is written in the
3rd column; the 4th column is the mean-square error of cc2431. The
position estimated by the proposed method is written in the 5th column,
and the 6th column is the mean-square error of LMRN. From this table,
we could observe that LMRN has noticeably better performance than
cc2431 in Tests 1, 2, 3, and 4; however, cc2431 is only slightly better
than LMRN in Test 5. Note also that LMRN estimates the tag position
much faster than LFRN.
Finally, we would like to provide several observations from our actual experimental tests.
• To examine effect according to the antenna orientation, we measured the received-signal-strengths while rotating the mobile tag.

No particular variation of performance due to antenna orientation
was observed.
• With more reference nodes, the overall quality is only slightly
improved. For further discussion of this topic, refer to [16].
• Since our system uses RF signals to communicate between reference nodes and mobile tags, the performance can be affected
by surrounding objects, most notably by metallic objects. We also
observed that the initial radiation intensity is dependent on the gap
between the RF circuit board and the wall. Thus, in future efforts,

it is necessary to pay more attention to the RF circuit board design, to ensure it is more robust in terms of hardware and against
interference from metallic objects.
• Our system is based on a ZigBee communication; thus, overall
communication is governed by the ZigBee protocol (IEEE
802.15.4). If congestion exists during the network transfer, the
tag transmits a resend signal to the nodes (or an acknowledgement signal when a signal is safely received), thus all signals are
confirmed to be safely transmitted. From the experiments, the

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we proposed a localization method referred to as an
environmental-adaptive RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL) that
is tolerant to parameter variations caused by environmental variations.
Here, two algorithms, LFRN and LMRN, have been implemented in
a ZigBee-based (2.4 GHz RF communication system) sensor network.
The hardware required for these tests was developed and subsequently
tested in an office environment. From the comparisons with an existing
localization chipset Chipcon cc2431, a dominant RSSI-based localization product, we found that LFRN locates the position of an object
more accurately than cc2431 as time increases. Moreover, LMRN estimates the tag position much faster than LFRN and computes the position more accurately in an open space; four cases out of five were
better than cc2431 and the other case was only slightly worse than
cc2431. Thus, we can confirm that LFRN is particularly helpful for
the position estimation of a stationary object in an office environment,
whereas LMRN is more practical for use in robot applications in an
open space. Since EARIL is based on RSSI, the system is very simple
and the cost of implementation is much cheaper than time-of-arrival
(TOA) and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based methods. Finally,
it is stressed that EARIL has a novel feature of environmental adaptation; that is, the mobile tag is able to compute its position using an
online-updated propagation model parameter.
4From our experimental tests we found that the sampling times of the existing
WSN localization systems such as UWB (example: Ubisense system (http://
www.ubisense.net) [1], [8]) and ZigBee (example: Chipcon cc2431) are several
seconds.

Abstract—This paper describes a concerted effort to design and implement a robotic service framework. The proposed framework is comprised
of three conceptual spaces: physical, semantic, and virtual spaces, collectively referred to as a ubiquitous robotic space. We implemented a prototype robotic security application in an office environment, which confirmed
that the proposed framework is an efficient tool for developing a robotic
service employing IT infrastructure, particularly for integrating heterogeneous technologies and robotic platforms.
Index Terms—Localization network, mobile robot, navigation, ubiquitous robotic space, wireless sensor network.

I. INTRODUCTION

A

MBIENT intelligence denotes a digital environment that proactively, but sensibly, supports people in their daily lives [1]. From
a robotics viewpoint, this type of smart space further supports a robot in
understanding the environment and thus improves its interaction capability. Robotic Room [2], Omniscient Space [3], and WABOT-House
[4] are a few examples of smart spaces that incorporate robotics.
Since the implementation of a smart space requires the integration
of a large number of heterogeneous components, architectural issues
have also received much attention. As examples, Luo and colleagues
described a prototypical configuration for networked robot systems
[5]; Distributed Intelligent Network Device (DIND) [6] proposed by
Hashimoto et al. is one of the earliest works to implement an intelligent

space using networked devices (e.g., networked cameras). In addition,
McKee and colleagues proposed a framework for networked robotic
systems and the concept of a module that represents a networked resource, and also acts as an interface between other modules [7]. Saffiotti and colleagues proposed Physically Embedded Intelligent System
(PEIS) ecology, characterized by ambient intelligence and networked
robot systems [8]. Kim and colleagues introduced a ubiquitous function
service and described an intelligent space that incorporates networked
robot systems from a control point-of-view [9].
In this paper, we propose a ubiquitous robotic space (URS), which
refers to a special environment in which robots are supported in understanding the environment through distributed sensing and computing,
and thus can intelligently respond to human needs in the current context
of the space. Fig. 1 illustrates the conceptual structure of the proposed
URS.
The URS comprises three spaces: physical, semantic, and virtual
space; Table I describes the structural features of the respective works
introduced above, as well as the primary differences from our current
work. It should be noted that the structural and functional roles of the
three proposed spaces are similar to the work conducted by Saffiotti and
colleagues [8]. As opposed to the aforementioned works, however, we
paid much attention to the issue in integrating a large number of heterogeneous technologies and robotic components in the implementation
of an actual robotic service. This paper describes how we developed
the fundamental elements of each space and how we could integrate the
three independently developed spaces into an actual robotic application.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the basic elements of the physical space and characteristics of
each individual element. Section III introduces the semantic space and
its elements. The virtual space is described in Section IV, and a robotic
security application based on the proposed ubiquitous robotic space is
described in Section V. Section VI then concludes this paper and introduces further works.
II. THE PHYSICAL SPACE
Wireless sensor networks and localization networks are two fundamental components supporting the physical space, controlling the behavior of a robot inside the physical space. Another component essen-
