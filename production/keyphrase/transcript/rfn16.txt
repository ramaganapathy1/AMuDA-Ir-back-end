Abstract— In this work we present a set of integrated
methods that enable an RFID-enabled mobile manipulator to
approach and grasp an object to which a self-adhesive passive
(battery-free) UHF RFID tag has been affixed.
Our primary contribution is a new mode of perception that
produces images of the spatial distribution of received signal
strength indication (RSSI) for each of the tagged objects in an
environment. The intensity of each pixel in the ‘RSSI image’
is the measured RF signal strength for a particular tag in the
corresponding direction. We construct these RSSI images by
panning and tilting an RFID reader antenna while measuring
the RSSI value at each bearing. Additionally, we present a
framework for estimating a tagged object’s 3D location using
fused ID-specific features derived from an RSSI image, a
camera image, and a laser range finder scan.
We evaluate these methods using a robot with actuated,
long-range RFID antennas and finger-mounted short-range
antennas. The robot first scans its environment to discover
which tagged objects are within range, creates a user interface,
orients toward the user-selected object using RF signal strength,
estimates the 3D location of the object using an RSSI image
with sensor fusion, approaches and grasps the object, and uses
its finger-mounted antennas to confirm that the desired object
has been grasped.
In our tests, the sensor fusion system with an RSSI image
correctly located the requested object in 17 out of 18 trials
(94.4%), an 11.1% improvement over the system’s performance
when not using an RSSI image. The robot correctly oriented
to the requested object in 8 out of 9 trials (88.9%), and in 3
out of 3 trials the entire system successfully grasped the object
selected by the user.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an umbrella
term for a variety of transponder systems, including active
(battery-powered) and passive (battery-free) tags of widely
varying complexity and capabilities. In this work we concentrate on simple, low-cost passive UHF RFID tags, often
called “smart labels,” based on the widely adopted EPC
Global Generation 2 communication protocol [1]. Currently
available passive UHF RFID tags are battery-free, with a read
range exceeding 5 meters and data storage capacities ranging
from 128 bits to over 1K-bit. They currently cost less than
$0.10 USD in volume. To date, RFID tags have typically
been used in a purely binary fashion, returning tag IDs for
each tag in range, or indicating that no tag was found. Prior
work has shown how this binary tag sensing modality can
be used to improve robot localization, mapping, navigation,
and unique object detection.

RFID antennas (top) and short-range near-field RFID antennas on the end
effector (bottom).

Recent work has shown that there is valuable information
present in the tag’s RF signal itself, beyond the tag ID [2].
In our prior work, we have used estimates of received signal
strength from passive RFID tags to inform robotic behaviors,
both in the context of servoing an RFID-enabled robot toward
a tagged object [3] and estimating a tag’s position relative
to the robot via particle filtering [4]. Here we present a new
method for RFID-based sensing that uses the receive signal
strength indication (RSSI) to form an RSSI image that can

be fused with 2D images from a co-located camera and 3D
point clouds from a co-located scanning laser range finder.
We also show that the unique ID of a tag can be associated
with perceptual characteristics of the object to which it is
affixed, which in turn can facilitate object detection with this
fused image. By combining the camera image, laser range
finder scan, RSSI image, and object-specific data associated
with this unique tag ID, our method is able to efficiently
produce an estimate of the 3D location of a selected tagged
object.
We have tested this approach in an object fetching application with EL-E, the autonomous mobile manipulator shown
in Figure 1. In our tests, the robot first scans its environment
to enumerate the tagged objects are in the environment.
Based on the tag responses from the enumerated tagged
objects, the robot then constructs a user interface from which
the user can select an object to be fetched.
After selection, the robot servos its orientation such that
the tagged object of interest is visible by both its camera
and laser scanner. The servoing process maximizes the RSSI
obtained from two long-range, actuated antennas reading the
selected tag. The robot then constructs an RSSI image by
panning and tilting one of these antennas and recording
the RSSI signal for each bearing in terms of azimuth and
elevation. The robot also captures an optical image with
a calibrated color camera and a range scan using a tilting
laser range finder. Each sensor’s output is geometrically
transformed to produce an output as a function of bearing
in the robot’s reference frame, so it is straightforward to
fuse these three data sets into a single data set indexed by a
single {azimuth, elevation} bearing pair. Additional features
associated with each tagged object that have been associated
with the tag’s unique ID are read from a database and used
to aid in finding the object in the fused image. This process
results in a 3D estimate of the object’s location, which the
robot uses to approach and grasp the object using a system
we have previously described [5], [6].

A wide variety of research has been conducted on the
application of RFID technology to robotics. This includes
RFID-enhanced interaction between robots and tagged people and objects, such as that described in [7], where tags
facilitate person/object identification. There is also a great
deal of prior work in RFID augmented indoor navigation
[8], where tags are used as either a waypoint navigation and
landmarking system [9], or more commonly as a component
of a robot’s localization and mapping system. Several recent works employ long-range passive UHF (902-928MHz)
RFID, in addition to laser rangefinders and odometry, as
sensor inputs to a probabilistic SLAM algorithm, for example
[10]. In these prior results, the RFID system only reports the
tag IDs of visible RFID tags, or indicates that no tag is found.
In contrast, our work explicitly takes advantage of RF signal
information.
An alternative RFID-enhanced navigation approach uses
short-range (≈1m) magnetically coupled passive RFID tags
[11] to detect when robots pass above tagged waypoints.
Again, however, a binary indication of tag presence or
absence is all that is reported by the RFID system. Recent
work in active (battery-powered) tagging [12] demonstrates
navigation to a relatively expensive, battery powered target
tag in a cluttered environment. In the latter work, a mechanically rotating reader antenna with a deep null in its radiation
pattern is used to find bearings from the reader to the active
tag. Other complex or expensive tag-centric antenna design
techniques have also been explored to find range and bearing
[13].
Numerous RFID tag localization approaches have been
considered, including binary (read / no-read) histogram techniques [10] and RSSI techniques employing both histograms
and sensor models, [2] and [4] respectively. While localization methods that estimate range and bearing posteriors may
yield volumetric regions of interest, these methods tend to
marginalize over the entire robot trajectory. We believe a
compelling, potentially complementary, approach is to create
2D “images” of RF signal properties at a fixed robot location
to provide valuable insights into the otherwise invisible RF
world. To this end, we introduce RSSI images, shown in
Figure 3, which capture the RSSI signal characteristics as
a function of bearing (azimuth and elevation) in a manner
analogous to an optical camera’s visible light images.
In the fields of computer vision and augmented reality,
there are many examples of systems that employ identifying
fiducials, such as optical tags, coupled with a perceptual
database. For example, QR codes have been used for both
identification and 6DOF estimation for a manipulation task
[14], while RFID tags have also been used in a database
approach to identify perception and action primitives in a
scene [15].
This work is differentiated in several ways: First, we
believe this work to represent the first use of RSSI images as a distinct sensing modality. Further, we describe a
probabilistic framework for sensor fusion, employing object-

centric features extracted from a database as indexed by the
unique tag ID. Additionally, we demonstrate a user interface
that allows users to select tagged objects from those present
in the environment. Finally, we employ this framework to
create a system capable of performing mobile manipulation
of tagged objects.
III. RSSI I MAGES
Recent advances in RFID reader technology have made
RF signal properties such as the Receive Signal Strength
Indication (RSSI) available as metadata for each tag read
by the reader. In its most basic form, RSSI is a scalar
measurement of the tag’s RF signal power as received at
the reader. For example, we employ a ThingMagic Mercury
5e RFID reader which returns an RSSI value that is linearly
related to received power in dBm. The raw reported RSSI
value ranges from 70 to 100 units, though it saturates with
very strong tag responses at a value of ≈ 105. Many system
implementation and environmental factors affect the absolute
value of the RSSI reported for a particular tag. We are
primarily interested in RSSI variation with distance and
bearing to each tag, but system implementation parameters
such as transmit power, reader antenna characteristics, tag
antenna characteristics also influence the absolute value of
RSSI. In our work these system parameters are fixed, and do
not vary with tag range and bearing. The RF properties of
the robot’s environment including occlusion, multipath, and
interference are difficult to model and can also be significant,
but we have found that they need not be modeled for nearby
tags where line-of-sight propagation is dominant.
To construct an RSSI image, one of the robot’s two long
range, far-field RFID antennas is positioned in front of the
robot, placing it approximately coincident with the tilting
laser rangefinder and camera. The antenna is panned and
tilted through azimuth and elevation angles while recording
RSSI readings associated with a desired tag ID. A single
slice of the radiation pattern for the antenna we employ,
the Cuschcraft S9028PC circularly polarized patch antenna,
is illustrated in Figure 4. This antenna has horizontal and
vertical half-power beamwidths of ≈ 60◦ . This antenna
beamwidth is the limiting factor in the precision of this
sensor; advances in digitally scanned array antennas could

produce higher resolution images much faster than the pantilt mechanical scanning we are currently using. The resulting
RSSI values are then mapped into a single image, roughly
corresponding to a camera image. Next, the raw image is
smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation
of 45 pixels, corresponding to ≈ 7◦ of pan or tilt. Lastly, the
intensity values of the RSSI image are scaled to occupy the
range [0.0, 1.0].
IV. S ENSOR F USION
The goal of our approach to sensor fusion is to combine
the RSSI image for a particular tagged object ID with objectspecific features extracted from other sensing modalities. We
provide a probabilistic framework for fusing these sensing
modalities and associated features to produce a single maximum likelihood 3D location that is used by the mobile
manipulation system to retrieve the tagged object.
A. Registering the Sensors
In this work, we consider the output of three approximately coincident sensors with overlapping fields of view:
the RSSI image, a low resolution (640x480) camera image
from a rectified camera, and a 3D point cloud from a
tilting laser rangefinder. In order to fuse the output of these
three sensors, we first geometrically register them with one
another. We accomplish this by transforming both the RSSI
image and the 3D point cloud into the camera image.
For the 3D point cloud, we estimated the 6DOF transformation from the laser rangefinder to the camera by hand
measurements, and then refined this estimate using visualization software that displays the transformed 3D point cloud
on the corresponding camera image. Transforming the 3D
point cloud results in a range image, Irange (x, y), that is
registered with the camera image, Icam (x, y).
For the RSSI image, we first convolve the raw RSSI
image with a Gaussian, G(φ, θ) ∗ RSSIraw (φ, θ), and then
scale the resulting values to occupy the range [0.0, 1.0]. We
then transform the resulting smoothed RSSI image into the

camera image with a simple linear interpolation based on
hand measured correspondences between the RFID antenna’s
azimuth and elevation, (φ, θ), and the camera’s pixels, (x, y).
This results in the registered RSSI image, Irssi (x, y), as
shown in Figure 3. Given the low spatial resolution of our
current RSSI images and the near coincident location of
the camera and antenna, this transformation is effective.
However, we expect that more accurate registration would
improve system performance.
B. Inferring a Tag’s 2D Image Location
The fused image I consists of a set of n feature images
I0 ...In , where each feature image Ii represents the spatially
varying value of feature Fi . We model each of these features
as being generated with some probability pfi |tag (Fi , True),
if a tag is at the bearing associated with the location. If a tag
is not at the bearing associated with the location, we model
the probability of a given feature value as pfi |tag (Fi , False).
We further model these feature values as being conditionally
independent given the presence or absence of the tag at
the bearing associated with the location, and as independent
from one another. Given these assumptions, we can find the
probability that a tag is at a given location using Bayes’ rule:

ptag|f0 ...fn (V, F0 ...Fn ) =

Qn
=

i=1

pf0 ...fn |tag (F0 ...Fn , V )ptag (V )
pf0 ...fn (F0 ...Fn )

pfi |tag (Fi , V ) ptag (V )
Qn
i=1 pfi (Fi )

= ptag (V )

(2)

n
Y
pfi |tag (Fi , V )
i=1

(3)

pfi (Fi )

We assume a uniform prior on the position of each tag,
ptag (V ). Assuming independence of the feature vectors for
each
x, y location of the fused image I, pimage (I) =
Q
pf0 ...fn |tag (I(x, y), V (x, y)). And,
pfi (Ii (x, y)) = pfi |tag (Ii (x, y), True) +

(4)

pfi |tag (Ii (x, y), False).
The maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the location of
the tag is then
(
argmaxx,y

n
Y
pfi |tag (Ii (x, y), True)

i=1

pfi (Ii (x, y))

)
.

(5)

The result of this argmax operation selects a pixel,
(xml , yml ), in the fused image. In the subsequent section,
we will show how this pixel may be mapped into the 3D
point cloud produced by the tilting laser range finder to
produce a single maximum-likelihood 3D location for the
tagged object. This interaction is illustrated in Figure 2.

C. Inferring a Tag’s 3D Location
In order to effectively apply this method of probabilistic inference, we select discriminative feature(s) from each
sensing modality. The selection of discriminating features
could employ feature sets, models, and / or training data
available from a database indexed by the tag’s ID. In
this work, we consider three features indexed by tag ID.
First, the feature from the RSSI image consists of the
RSSI value from Irssi (x, y). The associated probabilities,
prssi|tag (RSSI, True) and prssi|tag (RSSI, False), were obtained as a histogram from 60 hand-labeled ground-truth
observations as shown in Figure 5. From the camera image, we employed color histograms as the visual feature.
We selected color histograms for their simplicity. Other
visual features could be integrated into this framework and
may be more discriminative. For the color histogram, the
object probability, pcolor|tag (Icam (x, y), True), is obtained
from an image of the tagged object stored in the tagindexed database. Meanwhile, the non-object background
probability, pcolor|tag (Icam (x, y), False), is generated from
a color histogram accumulated over the set of images of the
environment collected during navigation.
For the laser, there are many candidate features, from spin
images [16] to 3D segmentations as applied in our previous
work [17]. In this work we have treated the laser as a special
case, where point 3D (p3d) features are used to produce a
binary mask on the image:

pp3d|tag (P 3D, V )
1.0
P3D ∈ laser scan
=
0.0
¬P 3D ∈ laser scan
pp3d (P 3D)
This ensures that any pixel selected by argmaxx,y produces a direct mapping to a valid 3D location based on laser
range scans. After all three sensor images are fused, the
maximum likelihood pixel is selected, and the corresponding
3D location from the laser is chosen. A montage showing this
method is shown in Figure 6.
V. M OBILE M ANIPULATION S YSTEM
The fused sensor image is incorporated as follows into
the mobile manipulation system. The robot first uses the
RFID antennas to scan the environment for tagged objects
in the environment. The object names associated database
images corresponding to each tag ID are presented to a
remote user via the graphical user interface shown in Figure
7. The user can select an object from an array of database
photos, indexed by the observed tag ID of each tagged object.
After the user selects a tagged object, the robot estimates
a bearing to the tag of interest. The robot rotates to that
bearing, placing the object within the other sensors’ field
of view. The robot proceeds by performing sensor fusion
as previously described, which results in a 3D estimate of
the object’s location. The robot then uses the 3D estimate
of the object’s location to approach and grasp the object
using an overhead grasp with methods we have previously
described [5], [6], [17]. Finally, after the grasp attempt is
completed, the RFID antennas in the robot’s end effector
(see Figure 1) are used to determine success or failure by

white points in the image), the selected pixel in red, and the projection of this pixel back into the 3D laser rangefinder data. Note: In this example, the
fused result is correct, while the color histogram alone is ambiguous and yields an incorrect result.

objects available to be grasped by the robot.

confirming the tag ID of the object being grasped. In our
experimental work thus far, we classify experimental trials
as successes or failures depending on whether the correct
object is successfully grasped.
A. Bearing Estimation
In order to successfully fuse images from multiple sensors,
the robot must servo its pose so that the field of view of
all sensors includes the desired object. In previous work we
rotated the robot toward the tagged object by maximizing
selected-tag RSSI from an antenna mounted at a fixed pose
on the robot [3]. In the present work the pan/tilt antennas
mounted on the robot permit keeping the robot in a fixed
position while scanning only the RFID antennas. The RSSI
values from the two pan/tilt antennas are combined to form
a dataset of RSSI versus robot bearing. We obtain the
bearing from the robot to the tag by fitting to a secondorder exponential parameterized by [α, µ, σ, β]T using least
squares:
n
o
2
argmaxx α · e−(x−µ) /σ + β
(6)
This operation is shown graphically in Figure 8. The bearing process is repeated twice to account for the uncertainty
behind the robot where the articulated antennas cannot sense
tags due to mechanical interference with the robot’s body.

antenna had no reads) fitted with a 2nd order exponential function. The
argmax{θ} from this fit is the estimated bearing to the tagged object.

VI. R ESULTS
A. Evaluating 3D Location Estimation
We performed a number of tests of the sensor fusion
system’s accuracy when estimating tagged object locations in
3D. For our test scenario, we chose three objects with distinct
color histograms: a red water bottle, a blue medication box,
and an orange disposable beverage bottle, shown in the top of
Figure 9. We chose two cluttered but unobstructed scenes and
three locations (shown in Figure 9) within each scene where
each of the three objects was tested, resulting in a total of
18 3D location estimation trials. The algorithm from Figure
6 was executed for each trial and was deemed successful if
the 3D point derived from the fused image belonged to the
desired object. The 3D location estimation was successful in
17 of the 18 trials (94.4%), with the only failure occurring
for the orange disposable drink bottle due to a proximal
orange distractor in the color histogram image. It is worth
noting that the success rate without the RSSI image on the
same dataset was 15 of 18 (83.3%); thus, incorporation of
the RSSI image resulted in an 11.1% improvement in the
system’s performance.

Fig. 9. Three test objects: red water bottle, blue medication box, and
orange disposable bottle (top). The two scenes and their three associated
object placement locations are indicated. The sole failure occurred when the
orange disposable bottle was placed in the upper-right placement location
in the bottom scene.

Fig. 10. Three different bearing estimation scenarios, with object locations
highlighted. Bearing estimation was attempted for all three objects, each in
the three different locations (9 total attempts). In 8 of 9 instances, the robot
correctly achieved a bearing that placed the tagged object in the fused sensor
image.

B. Evaluating Bearing Estimation
We tested bearing estimation in 3 different positions, for
the same three objects used in the fused image experiments.
The bearing estimation cases, illustrated in Figure 10 where
successful in 8 of 9 trials (88.9%), where success was defined
by halting with the desired object within fused image’s field
of view.
C. Evaluating Mobile Manipulation
We performed three tests of the entire mobile manipulation
system. In all three trials, the robot successfully grasped the
correct object and verified the ID of the object post-grasp
using the RFID antennas in the manipulator (see Figure 1).
VII. L IMITATIONS AND F UTURE W ORK
The methods we propose have a variety of limitations
which may be mitigated in future work. The performance
of RFID tags can vary considerably depending on their
orientation, the materials composing the object, and the RF
properties of the environment (e.g., transmission, absorption,

reflection, multipath interactions, etc.). We expect that issues
with orientation and some forms of environmental obstruction can be mitigated by affixing multiple tags to the same
object, or by using recently-developed UHF RFID tags with
improved omnidirectional performance. Recently developed
UHF RFID tags have also been introduced for challenging
object materials, including metal objects which would not
work well with the tags we used in our experiments.
Faster methods to acquire scanned RFID data, including
digitally scanned antenna arrays, would have a variety of
advantages, including the ability to handle dynamic environments and make additional estimates from different
perspectives. We expect that flash LIDAR “range cameras”
and digitally scanned RFID antenna arrays could achieve performance at rates that are comparable to conventional video
camera framerates. Being able to quickly make additional
estimates from various perspectives would be advantageous
for overcoming environmental RF issues and could be inte-

grated into 3D estimation techniques related to our previous
work on particle filters [4].
The choice of discriminating features for each sensing
modality is critical to the robustness of the system. In
this work we used color histograms as a straightforward
example, but an unfavorable environment could easily lead to
confusion. For future work, we plan to incorporate additional
descriptive features from the various sensing modalities.
Further, as shown in Figure 11, the RSSI is informative
even when the remaining sensors cannot perceive the desired
object. We believe this represents an interesting avenue for
further research.
VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
We have presented an integrated set of methods that enable
a mobile manipulator to grasp an object to which a selfadhesive UHF RFID tag has been affixed. Among other contributions, we have introduced the use of RSSI images to help
detect and localize tagged objects, along with a framework
for estimating a tagged object’s 3D location using a fused
sensory representation and sensory features associated with
the unique identifier obtained from the object’s RFID tag.
We evaluated our methods using a robot that first scans
an area to discover which tagged objects are within range,
creates a user interface, orients to the user-selected object
using RF signal strength, estimates the 3D location of the
object using an RSSI image with sensor fusion, approaches
and grasps the object, and then uses its finger-mounted
antennas to confirm that the desired object has been grasped.
This work demonstrates that RFID-based perception has
the potential to become integral to all aspects of mobile
manipulation including the discovery of what objects are
available, the production of customized user interfaces, the
navigation of the robot to objects, and the manipulation of
objects.
