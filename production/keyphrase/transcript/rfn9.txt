WinRFID Middleware
“WinRFID provides a
seamless RFID system
which can deliver intelligent information”

The WinRFID edge-of-the-network technology is developed in the WINMEC
RFID Lab. It is being developed on Microsoft .NET framework. WinRFID middleware addresses important features such as infrastructure scalability and administration, event and data intelligent process and dispatching, and enterprise application and business partner integration. Different support modules have also
been designed to facilitate easy deployment, security, and data preparation. The
middleware has a set of application programming and integration interfaces for
supporting application development. At same time, WinRFID has plug-in capability to accommodate symbiotic technologies such as location services and
sensors. These would not only enhance the technological effectiveness of the
RFID system, but also add value to the business processes.

“This edge-of-thenetwork technology
enables rapid integration of RFID to existing
enterprise applications.”

WinRFID provides a seamless RFID system which can deliver intelligent information by ﬁltering and aggregating data collected at the edge of an RFID network
from a variety of transponders through diverse readers. WinRFID infrastructure
technology is being tested for a diverse set of applications including medical/healthcare, asset tracking, supply chain, retail, library/document tracking,
security and e-pedigree. This edge-of-the-network technology enables rapid
integration of RFID to existing enterprise applications.

WinRFID Features
• Provides a rapid, platform independent application development
environment. Supports various application scenarios. Developer
friendly and standard-following SDK speeds up the time to market.
Easy to deploy, manage and control reader network.
• Provides robust scalability, integration and upgrading. Provides
a centralized and edge-of-network processing rule engine that supports deployment capabilities and event notiﬁcation.
• Provides intelligent data capturing, smoothing, ﬁltering, routing
and aggregation. Uses XML framework and SOAP for data and event
representation to support interoperability. Distributed database and local data cache are used to provide data persistence and consistency.
• Supports a variety of readers/tags from different hardware
vendors (Frequencies from LF, HF to UHF, Protocols from EPC, ISO to
ICode, Tiris and other vendor-speciﬁed protocols). Web-Service based
interface Accommodates third-party hardware (readers, sensors)
plug-ins. Standards based framework allows rapid integration of new
readers.
• Web Services based distributed architecture - ripe for connected
systems and SOA paradigms are under development.
• EPC compliant to provide EPC solution and support business partner integration.
• Data Delivery Framework facilitates both subscription (pull)
and distribution (push) models. The data can be delivered based on
event triggers, time and date, exception, location or a combination of
these modes. The data delivery can be setup as message exchanges, user-deﬁned cache or direct hooks to data bases.
• A comprehensive management console provides a single point
of interaction to the RFID network. Allows deployment and control
of all the readers and sensor nodes in the network and assigns unique
identity to each; on-the-ﬂy customization of operational parameters
(protocols, reading logic, processing logic, group aggregated reading,
etc.); assign and modify authentication and access restriction policies;
assign and modify data collection and processing rules, and other
functions.
• Supports data collection from a variety of integrated event sensors such as temperature, humidity, pressure, vibration, etc as well as
GPS for location. These add value to logistics, cargo transportation
and other supply chain activities, and facilitate in-transit visibility of
assets with real-time condition and location.
• Supports an integrated bar code engine capable of generating
bar code and/or EPC or other RFID compliant data, facilitates seamless data transcription from bar code to RFID tag and vice versa,
interfaces with barcode readers with RS232, IrDA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
communication interfaces with continuous or intermittent data transfer
capabilities. Currently a number of bar code standards are supported
- CODE39, EAN8, EAN13, UPCA, CODE128 and PDF417.

RFID Test-Bed
The RFID research program Test-Bed at WINMEC is built on WinRFID Middleware. The Test-Bed provides full functionality to support WinRFID and serves as
a RFID rapid application development environment for proving a variety of RFID
application concepts. A tag/reader performance module can be used to test
most available tags and readers. In this Test-Bed, various networking technologies are being used for simulating enterprise environment. Several applications
are also available for verifying real time visibility and operation of RFID technology in Supply Chain System and Asset Tracking. A low cost smart shelf, demonstrating item management at retail shop, is also available.
The Test-Bed can provide information to choose the right RFID technology for
right application.
Mission

“The Test-Bed can
provide information to
choose the right RFID
technology for a given
application.”

“.. lab serves as a
RFID rapid application
development and test
environment.”

At UCLA-WINMEC , we work with in assisting our industrial partners accomplish
three critical tasks:
• Incorporation of the WinRFID middleware layer into their application
• Assist in the selection of RFID equipment and help with change in their engineering process if needed
• Work with them in justiﬁcation of the business case for the use of RFID

WinRFID Applications

WinRFID middleware Version 1.1 in the WINMEC RFID Lab provides edge-of-the network intelligence in
RFID infrastructure along with various RFID information services facilitating RFID enablement or existing
enterprise applications or the creation of new applications. The middleware provides a rapid application development platform and easy to integrate interfaces. It is being tested for a variety of applications
including medical/healthcare, asset tracking, supply chain, retail, library/document tracking and access
control, etc. The above applications are available based on WinRFID middleware ( http://winmec.ucla.
edu/rﬁd ) at the WINMEC RFID Lab ( http://winmec.ucla.edu/rﬁdlab ).

RF-DVD: A DRM Solution for Entertainment Media Industry.
RF-DVD: A DRM Solution for Entertainment Media Industry. In this initiative, a framework for protecting
and applying DRM policies on digital media content like DVDs is being investigated. Abbreviated RFDVD, the work involves using RFID for media authentication. * Status: Prototype under development to
be demonstrated soon.

System. Packaging System prepares
tags, manages hierarchy information including pallet information, case
information and item information, and
then writes them into pallet tag, case
tag and item tag respectively. Warehouse Check In System reads all the
information on pallet tag and send back
to backend system. Smart Shelf for
