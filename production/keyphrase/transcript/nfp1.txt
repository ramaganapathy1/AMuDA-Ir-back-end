between the end users. Such networks that employ a
central entity for enabling communication between the
end users are referred to as infrastructure networks.
802.11 networks may also operate in a distributed manner
without a central AP. This mode is often known as the ad
hoc mode of operation. Simplified architectural
representation of 802.11 networks has been shown in
Figure 1 [1]. Note that in order to provide positioning
services, only the infrastructure-based 802.11 networks
are used.
802.11 networks are inherently designed for indoor
low-mobility network applications. For example, they may
be deployed in an office building to connect the
employees to a network without running cables and wires.
While these indoor APs are primarily meant to provide
communication services for the end users, their use in
more innovative applications is also being examined by
the research community. More recently, the research
interest in using Wi-Fi networks for positioning purposes
has risen significantly. The Global Positioning System (GPS)
is generally used for positioning purposes but its service
deteriorates when it is employed in the indoor
environments. This fact has fuelled the research activities
in enabling Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS). Since Wi-Fi
networks are not primarily meant to support localization
services, employing WPS poses significant research
challenges that are currently being pursued. WPS uses the
signal strengths of periodic beacon signals transmitted by
the APs to locate a mobile node. These beacon signals are
broadcast every 100msec to advertise the presence of APs
in a certain area. The mobile nodes register their
willingness to connect to an AP by responding to these
beacon signals. WPS employs two methods of using the
Received Signal Strength (RSS) information from the
beacon signals. This paper overviews both methods,
namely Trilateration and Fingerprinting.

Abstract – The Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely
used for providing positioning services across the world. While
it performs well in the outdoor conditions where receivers
maintain LoS with the GPS satellites, the performance of GPS
quickly deteriorates in the indoor environments. Due to this
reason, the research interest in exploring 802.11 Wi-Fi
networks for providing positioning services has risen
significantly.
Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS) uses trilateration and
fingerprinting methods to determine a receiver’s position
typically in the indoor environment. In this paper, we discuss
these methods in the light of experimental observations. The
discussion is aimed at highlighting a few open research issues
pertinent to the effective use of Wi-Fi Positioning System.

Keywords – Wi-Fi Positioning, Trilateration, Fingerprinting,
Probability distributions.

I. INTRODUCTION
The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet is concerned with protocols
and standards that allow communication between the
devices over a wired Local Area Network (LAN). LANs use
guided media such as cables and wires to connect the end
users to the backhaul network, which is commonly the
internet. The IEEE 802.11 standard introduces the wireless
version of LANs, commonly known as Wi-Fi (or Wireless
LAN). The freedom from wires and the ease of mobility are
two important factors in the popularity and widespread
use of the 802.11 Wi-Fi networks. 802.11 networks have
been massively deployed in universities, offices, homes,
restaurants, airports, shopping malls, etc, ever since their
introduction in 1999. A typical Wi-Fi network is composed
of an Access Point (AP) connected to the backhaul
network on one end, and connected wirelessly to the
mobile nodes on the other end. These APs can be seen as
small base stations that liaison communication activity

formula to compute the position of the mobile node. The
main problem with this technique is the fluctuating nature
of the signal strength. This ever changing nature makes it
difficult to translate signal strength measures into distance.
The problem gets more complicated in the indoor
environments where the signal gets attenuated by various
objects [2]. Intuitively, signal strength decreases as the
distance between the mobile node and the AP is increased.
However, this inverse relation is difficult to express
mathematically. In fact, developing a mathematical model
that relates distance with the signal strength is still an
open area of research. Another problem with in using
trilateration is that the variation in the signal strength is
also affected by the orientation of the mobile node. The
following tests suggest that the trilateration method
should also take into account the orientation of a mobile
node for accurate positioning.
A laptop (with Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6230 wireless
card on Intel Mobile Express Chipset running Windows 7)
measures the received signal strength from an AP in the
indoor LoS conditions. Readings are taken at 6 steps such
that the horizontal distance between two consecutive
steps is approximately 7ft. The first step is also 7ft away
from the foot of the AP. At each step, 5 readings each in 4
directions (north, south, east and west) are taken. The
average of these 20 readings is recorded as the signal
strength observed at that step. For the readings taken in
the north direction, the antenna of the mobile node faces
the AP directly. On the other hand, for the readings taken
in the south direction, human body comes between the AP
and the mobile node. Figure 2 shows the signal strengths
recorded in each of the four directions at all 6 steps, and
their overall average. The differences in the curves
reported in Figure 2 show that orientation of the mobile
node affects the received signal strength considerably.
Note that the signal strengths recorded at steps 2 and 3
for the east and south directions are quite different. This
infers that, in trilateration method, information on signal
strength alone is not enough to make reasonable
predictions about the position of the mobile node.
Orientation of the mobile node also needs to be
considered to improve the positioning accuracy.
The orientation factor also needs to be accommodated
into any mathematical model that sets out to translate RSS
into distance. As mentioned earlier, accurate models to
translate signal strength measures into distance are still
not available. Because conversion of signal strength
measures into distance is a complex task due to the
unpredictable nature of the RSS [3], the Fingerprinting
method is often preferred over Trilateration in WPS.

This paper has been composed to provide an overview
of the Wi-Fi Positioning System. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. The next section discusses the
Trilateration and Fingerprinting methods with the help of
experiments. This paper is concluded in Section III while

end of this paper.

II. POSITIONING METHODS
Based on a variety of experiments, this section
discusses the Trilateration and Fingerprinting methods
used in WPS.
A. Trilateration method
The Trilateration technique uses the signal strength
measured from at least three APs to determine the 2D
position of a mobile device. The distance of a mobile node
from three APs can be used in the elementary distance

vehicular navigation, fingerprinting shall require extensive
drive tests across the cities on a periodic basis. Despite
these limitations, fingerprinting technique has been used
in various previous works and has shown reasonable
accuracy [4].
Matching an observed value with a pre-recorded
database can either be deterministic or probabilistic. In
deterministic matching, one-point or multi-point matching
[5, 6] is used to compare the observed values with a precalculated map. In probabilistic matching, signal strength
values are represented as a probability distribution (e.g.
Gaussian distribution), and the matching is done using
histograms or kernel methods [7]. As the name suggests,
probabilistic fingerprinting calculates the probability of a
user being at a certain location based on the online
measurements and RSS database. It follows that the RSS
database plays a vital role in finger-printing based
positioning.
The probabilistic fingerprinting method has been
examined in literature for controlled (under laboratory
settings with minimum perturbations) and uncontrolled
environments (typical office setting) both. Ideally, a
database trained for an area should exhibit the same
characteristics in both controlled and uncontrolled setups.
In order to investigate the temporal variations of the
database, we have conducted a simple fingerprinting
experiment on Wi-Fi networks. While most relevant works
focus on analyzing algorithms for data processing and
matching [8], this analysis discusses the probability
distribution of the database used in fingerprinting. The
main motivation is to check the differences in the
probability distributions corresponding to controlled and
uncontrolled setups. RSS samples from a particular AP are
recorded at 6 different locations in the Main Hall of the
Mechanical Engineering building at KAIST as shown in
Figure 3. At every test point, 5 samples are taken in each
of the four directions as shown in the figure. In this way,
20 samples are collected with 5-second sampling interval
at each test point (as opposed to 12 samples used in [9]).
Two such tests on two different days have been conducted
to represent the controlled and uncontrolled
environments.
The first test, known as the controlled test, was
conducted over the weekend when the hall remained
mostly empty. Little or no human motion was experienced
and the surrounding environment remained static. The
second test, known as the uncontrolled test, was
conducted on a weekday. Several people passed by the
area during the test and the mobile node experienced
large human motion.

uncontrolled tests.

B. Fingerprinting method
Location fingerprinting (also referred to as the scene
analysis method) identifies the user location by matching
the RSS observations made by the mobile node with a
trained database. This method compares the online
measurements made by the mobile device with those
recorded in a database to locate the device [4]. Hence, the
Wi-Fi fingerprinting method comprises of an online and an
offline phase. In the offline phase, the RSS fingerprints are
taken at different target locations throughout the area of
interest and recorded in a database. In the online phase,
the mobile device first measures the prevailing RSS value
and then matches it with the database. The geographical
location that corresponds to the observed signal strength
is recognized as the user location. It is obvious that Wi-Fi
fingerprinting requires extensive site surveys that are
labor intensive. Removal and/or addition of new APs in
the area of interest would require modifications in the
database. In high mobility applications, for example in

uncontrolled test. It can be seen that the data distribution
does not comply fully with the normal distribution,
particularly in the RSS range -70 to -67dBm. This deviation
may give rise to positioning inaccuracies if the dataset is
assumed to follow normal distribution. In the light of this
discussion, we conclude that different conditions in the
controlled and uncontrolled setup may bring about
changes in the probability distribution of the database.
These changes should be taken into account while using
the probabilistic fingerprinting method.

III. CONCLUSION
There has been increasing interest in exploring the use
of Wi-Fi networks for positioning purposes. This interest
has risen significantly because (i) GPS services are
suspended in the indoor non-LoS environments and (ii) a
large number of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) are already
deployed in the indoor setups. This paper is concerned
with providing an experimental overview of the
positioning methods use in the Wi-Fi Positioning Systems
(WPS). Based on a variety of experiments, the procedures
involved in the trilateration and fingerprinting methods
have been discussed.
It has been discussed that the trilateration method
attempts to translate the received signal strength into
distance between an AP and mobile node. However, the
variation in signal strength due to changing environment
as well as the orientation of the mobile node makes it
difficult to employ trilateriation for positioning. On the
other hand, fingerprinting method uses a database of
signal strength samples collected across the region of
interest to determine a device’s position. It has been
shown that the probability distributions of the database
generated for the same area under controlled and
uncontrolled conditions may be different. Therefore, all
analyses and performance evaluation pertinent to
fingerprinting must be done in real uncontrolled setup.

Figure 6: PDF and Normal fit of uncontrolled dataset.

The cumulative distribution function and probability
plot of the recorded samples for the two tests along with
the corresponding normal fits have been shown in Figure 4
and Figure 5 respectively. A rough visual assessment of the
figures reveals that the samples conform to the Normal
distribution. Also note that very little variation exists in the
probability distributions of the samples recorded for
controlled and uncontrolled tests. To determine the
goodness of fit, Chi Square test was performed at the two
datasets. It was found that in case of the controlled test,
the null hypothesis that the samples were drawn from a
Normal distribution cannot be rejected. On the other hand,
in case of uncontrolled test the null hypothesis can be
rejected.
While the fingerprinting database was found to follow
normal distribution in both controlled and uncontrolled
setups, dataset’s conformity to the normal distribution is
better in the controlled environments. Figure 6 shows the
probability distribution of the samples collected during the
