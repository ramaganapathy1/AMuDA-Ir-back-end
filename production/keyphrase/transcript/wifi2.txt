Current approches of Wifi Positioning
Robin Henniges, TU-Berlin, 2012

Abstract—WiFi positioning plays an increasingly important
role in improving performance because good positioning can
improve performance in indoor environments without additional
devices. It will make use of existing WiFi infrastructure, although
this was never designed to do so. Methods that were used for
other positioning technologies can be adopted for WiFi. Whether
or not these other methods work with WiFi will be explained and
examined. This paper also discusses the accuracy of the methods
and the optimal area of application.

I. I NTRODUCTION

N 1978 the first GPS satellite was launched14 and in 1995
GPS worked with its full capability for the first time.1
Unfortunately, the satellite signals were not strong enough to
work indoors. In 1997 IEEE Standard 802.11 was set and the
first version of Wireless LAN was born.
Nowadays Wireless Local Area Network technology can be
found in almost every building. This widespread infrastructure
offers the possibility to locate mobile devices in an economical
way. Position determination using WiFi technology has the
advantage that it can perform indoors and outdoors, in a
different way to GPS. And, although WiFi was never made
for positioning, it is more accurate than a GSM indoor
positioning20 and, in some cases, it is also more accurate in
regards to outdoors. By using WiFi Positioning Systems it is
possible to locate the position of almost every WiFi compatible
device without installing extra software or manipulating the
hardware. In the course of time many methods that were
initially used with other positioning technologies were applied
to WiFi positioning. WiFi Positioning also allows the use of
location-based services (LBS) indoors, which is interesting for
the industry. Useful applications of this technology are, for
example, for indoor navigation at shopping malls or for finding
a lost child in an indoor area. Lost devices or items can also
be found with this technology. Additionally, this technology
is especially interesting for hospitals because sometimes when
staff move certain pieces of equipment it can be hard to
find them again straight away. Big corporate companies like
Google have already seen the potential of this system called
WiFi Positioning. As we all know, Google captures photos,
GPS positions and WiFi measurements, while collecting data
for the Google Street View project4 .5 This data was the basis
for the hybrid outdoors positioning system that they use today.
If a smartphone user turns on WiFi and Google Maps, he also
collects new WiFi positioning data for Google. The device
scans for stations (in this case access points) and, at the
same time, it determines the position with GPS, GSM or
known WiFi stations. In November 2011, Google published
Google Indoors which enables navigation in buildings. It is

also based on WiFi technology.16 Even in large train stations
or airports, a WiFi positioning system could help people to find
out when their next train or plane leaves. The programming
of autonomous robots often has the problem that the robot
does not always know where they are. WiFi positioning
could support the mechanisms that are already in place. The
second chapter is about the basic Theory of WiFi Technology.
802.11 is introduced and physical problems are discussed.
The third chapter is about the Positioning Theory. The three
topologies are explained and the different environment of
Indoors and Outdoors are discussed in terms of positioning.
The fourth chapter deals with the methods that are available
for positioning. Each method is examined to find out whether
it advertises itself to the topologies and whether it is suitable
for indoor WiFi positioning systems. This paper is about the
methods that can be used to build a WiFi Positioning System.
II. W IFI T ECHNOLOGY
A. WLAN, Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.11
WLAN, WiFi and IEEE 802.11 all mean the same: they determine the industrial standard for wireless data transmission.
The latter is the most used expression.
WiFi uses electromagnetic waves to transmit data over the
airwaves. In figure 2 (p. 2) the whole frequency spectrum is
shown, starting with radio signals and ending with gammarays. Looking at the illustration one can see that it operates
in broadband, on about 2,4 GHz and 5 GHz.10 Other longer
distance technologies also use frequencies in between these
figures. The frequency is the number of wave occurrences per
unit of time.
In the best case, the radio waves spread out evenly and lose
more and more of their signal strength with increasing radius.

A WiFi connection gives us information about signal
strength and interference.
For example: signal strength: -52 dBm ( 0,00001 mW )
interference: -90 dBm
Because of the path loss, the signal becomes weaker and
weaker the farther it is away from its origin. Barriers may
attenuate the signal (more about that later). The property to
the path loss can be used to determine the distance.
B. Problems and disruptive factors

Fig. 2.

frequency overview - A Wifi wave matches into a baseball.

This loss of signal strength is due to the energy transformation
because, in physics, energy is never lost, but instead converted.
Consequently the amplitude of the signal becomes smaller and
smaller. In an outdoor station the radius ratio of distance to
signal strength is inversely proportional, because the decrease
of the signal is log-normal.12 In conclusion, if the distance to
the station is increased in any direction, the signal strength will
decrease steadily. However, indoors we encounter a different
problem, because the waves bump into walls, windows, doors
and so on. If a wave bumps into a different material, it converts
more energy than in the air. During this process, the signal
strength is decreased more strongly, because the energy is
transferred to the material (e.g.: in heat). Furthermore the
signal is also reflected from the material. More about this
problem is following in the section entitled Problems and
interferences.22
1) Fundamentals for Wifi measuring: the distance between
the transmitter and the receiver has an important role in
determining the position. In contrast to GPS, WiFi, at a time
measurement method, does not come into question, since such
an exact time is difficult to achieve synchronization. Finally,
the path from space to the ground is much farther than from
one access point to a mobile device. The received signal
strength (RSS) and the signal noise ratio (SNR) are the most
suitable. These values can be calculated from the incoming
signals.
2) Signal Strength: the signal strength is measured in dBm
(decibel in milliwatt). A Wifi station has a EIRP (Equivalent
isotropically radiated power) of 100mW - 1000mW (20dBm
- 30dBm). This is how to calculate:
P
1mW

(1)

100mW
= 20dBm
1mW

(2)

Lp(dBm) = 10 ∗ log
For Example:
Lp(dBm) = 10 ∗ log

In general, wireless radio transmission is subject to many
confounding factors. Even the sun or rain drops have an effect
on the signal strength, actually even if this disruptive factor
is very low, it would still be measured. Another problem is
the electromagnetic radiation inside buildings. Additionally,
many walls, doors and floors have to be penetrated. The result
of this is attenuation. An additional problem is the wireless
overlay. In an office or apartment building, there are several
dozen wireless stations that provide much interference.
1) Signal attenuation of static environment: usually hits an
electromagnetic wave on a wall or another barrier it passes
through. However, the wave becomes weaker, due to reflection
that originates while striking the barrier. Another part is
absorbed and converted into heat, the factor of which is so
small that it would not be noticeable for a human. The size
of the loss is related to the material, specifically its thickness.
For example, glass has a higher attenuation effect than brick
walls.21 These factors are critical, especially with methods
which determine a distance by the measuring of the signal
strength.
2) Signal attenuation by user: As we can see in the experiment,13 the presence of a user changes the signal strength. This
is especially important for the Fingerprinting-based location
method, because the mean values would be influenced by the
presence of a user. ”When the positioning system is supposed
to cater to real users, it is essential to have the user present
while collecting the RSS values for the fingerprint and to
take into account the effect of the humans body.13 As already
mentioned, WiFi uses the frequencies of about 2,4 GHz, just
like microwaves. The effect that is used to heat up food with
a microwave is a disruptive effect with WiFi. This is because
the radiation is partially absorbed by the water in the human
body and the signal is attenuated.
III. P OSITIONING T HEORY
A. Topologien
There are three topologies that can be used for positioning.18
This first one is called network-based, here the position is
determined by the stations (which build a network) and a
central server. The next is called terminal-based and identifies
the position over the terminal (or mobile device). The last
topology is a hybrid form of the two. An illustration can be
seen in figure 3

urban surroundings is a WiFi infrastructure guaranteed. In
rural surroundings the chance for an outdoor WiFi positioning
system are not as good.
IV. M EASUREMENT THEORY

Fig. 3.

network-based, terminal-based and terminal-assisted topologie

1) network-based: The network-based approach works on
WiFi, only when the station software is modified because the
station must be able to redirect its measurement data (mostly
RSS and IDs) beside the normal network data. The sequence
looks like this: beacons of the mobile devices are received
by the stations and are redirected to a central server. This
server has a database and can use it to calculate the position.
For almost all of the positioning methods, preparations must
be made, for example: the positions of all stations with their
BSSIDs must be stored.
The mobile devices do not need any software installed,
instead they must just send beacons. Indeed, the mobile
devices do not take note of if they are located.
2) terminal-based: The terminal-based approach functions
exactly in the opposite way to the network-based approach.
The mobile devices receive the beacons of the stations. With
this, and with the information from the database, the position
can be calculated. A WiFi device is able, in a so-called
passive mode, to wait in the background for beacons from
WiFi stations, and can even be connected to a station. The
interval for sending beacons from a station lies at less than
10m. Another possibility is the active mode, and for this the
WiFi device sends out beacons, and with it the station sends
a reply back to the beacon. An important feature is that the
mobile device (or terminal) carries the database with it.
3) terminal-assisted: The terminal-assisted approach is a
mix of both of the above. The beacons are received by the
mobile device and the information is transferred to the central
server so the database can calculate the position.
B. Indoor and Outdoor Positioning
The indoors and outdoors have different requirements for
a WiFi positioning system. The indoor environment has man
disruptive factors like walls, windows, doors, and so on. A
positioning system must be able to handle these problems and
deliver good results. A higher accuracy is also required for the
indoors because it is important to locate a user at least in the
right room. A few meters can make a big difference. WiFi is
especially interesting for indoors because there are no other
positioning services running. Outdoor positioning has fewer
requirements. The accuracy is not as important outdoors as it is
indoors, but there are fewer environmental barriers. Coverage
is another problem in outdoor positioning because only in

There are many different approaches for locating a mobile
device using WiFi technology. In the following, the method
to estimate the sought position is described. In general, the
methods need to know the position of the WiFi stations
(=access points) as a reference point that are used for the
approximate position of the mobile device.7 A prerequisite
for a good-working WiFi positioning system is an adequate
coverage of the access points. This coverage is called Basic
Service Area (BSA). The expression of the BSA determines
which positioning method is the most suitable. The methods
differ in the minimum required number of stations and its
accuracy. This varies between building part accuracy and room
accuracy to an accuracy of a few meters difference.
A. Based on Proximity sensing
Methods based on proximity sensing are among the simplest
and fastest, but they are also imprecise. A position calculation
can be done with just a single station. It is hardly possible,
for example, to perform an indoor positioning that delivers
the right floors in a multi-storey building. As result, one gets
only the part of the building in which the mobile device is
located. On the other hand, this kind of positioning is popular
for outdoor positioning.
1) Cell Identity: A relatively simple method is called ”Cell
of Origin or ”Cell Identity and is based on ideas coming from
a GSM positioning method. To run a positioning system using
this method, some preparations must be made. A database of
station IDs and the geolocation is necessary. The position is
determined by measuring the signal strength. It is assumed
that the closest station is the station from which the strongest
incoming signal on the device is received. Depending on which
topology is used, a request to the database is performed for
the ID of the station with the strongest received signal. The
database returns the position of the desired station and thus the
position of the device. This is because a device within range
of the station has the approximate location of the station. So
this method is good for short-range technologies like WiFi.
If this method is used with WiFi as ID, the BSSID (basic
service set identification) is used, which is a unique hardware
address given to every WiFi device. In this case, the MAC address is used as BSSID, as explained in IEEE 802.11 BSSID.3
By using a network-based topology, the station collects tuple
from the mobile device IDs and its received signal strength,
and commits this information to a server that has access to
the database of station locations. The server now chooses
the station with the strongest signal as the position for the
mobile device. By using a terminal-based or terminal-assisted
topology, the mobile device can use the ”passive mode to scan
for active WiFi stations. After choosing the station with the
strongest signal, a simple search in the database will return the
position coordinates. However, unfortunately this information
is very inaccurate.

The disadvantage of this measuring method it that the size of
range is variable between 25 and 200 Meters, depending on the
measuring occurs indoors or outdoors.2 That makes indoor positioning with this method not very attractive. Indeed one could
run the stations with low power, so the radius is smaller and
the positioning would therefore be accurate. However, it also
negatively affects the data transmission and possibly the WiFi
coverage. It is also an important requirement, as with many
positioning methods, that the stations are fixed. If changes are
made to the location of the station, the database entry needs to
be corrected. This is a big problem for companies that use CI
in their positioning system, because they themselves must find
out if a stations location has been changed. The advantage of
the method is that it is very simple and therefore a position
determination is very fast. It works with at least one station
Summary:
• Positioning is based on the position of the station with
the stongest signal that can be received.
• (+) Can utilize existing wifi infrastructure without modifications
• (+) Allows network- and terminal-based positioning
• (-) Positioning is inaccurate
• (+) Allows real-time positioning
• Better for outdoor positioning.
B. Based on Trilateration
Lateration or trilateration is the determination of absolute
or relative locations of points by measurement of distances,
using geometry. The ”tri in trilateration reveals that at least
three fixed points are necessary to determine a position.
The idea behind the geometry is that all trilateration methods start with calculating the distance from a station to a
device. The distance then is used as the radius from the station.
Somewhere on the edge of the resulting circuit, the position
of the device is assumed. To lessen the possibilities, a second
group of results is also used from the measurements of another
station. Of course the second station has to be in the range of
the device.
With the radius of the second station one receives two
points. If one imagines this in a geometrical way, one keeps
two circles and two intersection points. One of the two points
is the position of the devices. To find out which point is
the right point a third station is used. An illustration of this

Fig. 5.

Trilateration (source: wikipedia.org)

geometry can be seen in figure 5. In the following the methods
of distance determination are explained.
Should the localisation deliver three dimensional results
which make sense, e.g., in multi-storey buildings, the additional fourth station is required to receive an unequivocal
position.
Because the distance measurements are not very accurate
it is recommended to use an ”Error range in the circles. This
compensates the measuring errors otherwise it is possible that
one does not get any intersection points.
The challenge for a Trilateration method lies in the best
possible determination of the distance between the station and
the device. Methods that are based on time measurements
have to guarantee a good synchronisation on the stations or
mobile devices. On the other hand, methods that are based
on the signal strength have problems with interferences and
reflection. Therefore, they are probably better suitable for
outdoors than for indoors.
1) Time of Arrival (ToA): With this method time is measured, which needs a signal from a station to mobile device
and back again, and in this instance it is called the ”Round trip
time (RTT). A requirement for this method is synchronically
running clocks. According to which topology is used, only the
clocks of the stations or also the clocks of the mobile devices
must run synchronically. With the measured data of the station
and the given speed of the signal, it can be calculated how far
away the mobile device is. Indeed, no time may pass with the
receiving and sending back of the signal because this would
influence the measured data. As this is not possible without
modification in mobile devices, this method does not function
with WiFi.

necessary.

SERVICE-CENTRIC NETWORKING - SEMINAR WS2011/2012

(-) Does not work with Wifi
2) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA): Like ToA, TDoA
also needs exact clock synchronisation. Indeed according to,6
TDoA is more popular with commercial detection systems
than ToA. With this method, the difference is used between the
arrival times of the signals to determine the position. Because
WiFi was never planned, nevertheless, to make such exact time
measurements, is also not possible to use TDoA on WiFi.
• Positioning is based ontrilateration with measurements of
time difference
• (-) At least three station in range of the device are
necessary.
• (-) Position coordinates of station must be exact.
• (-) Does not work with Wifi
3) Received Signal Strength (RSS): This method uses
propagation-loss of the WiFi signals to compute the distance.8
The decibel version of free space path loss equation is
s
) (s is the signal strength in watts). By using
10 log( 0.001
these measurements, which distance matches which signal
power can be found out. This method functions relatively well
outdoors, but in buildings it can come to strong divergences,
because the walls reflect and attenuate the WiFi signals. These
methods work with the WiFi technology and can be used for
the localisation. One can even use all three topologies with this
method, however, software must be modified with the routers
network-based topology.
• Positioning is based ontrilateration with measurements of
signal strength
• (-) At least three stations in range of the device are
necessary.
• (-) Position coordinates of station must be exact.
• (+) Does work with Wifi
• (+) Works well outdoors
• (-) Works indoors but doesnt deliver accurate values
• (+) supports all topologies
The method Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is neglected here
because it usually provides poorer results than RSS. Only
the fact that it exists should be mentioned. It works on the
same principle, but instead of transmitting power, the measured
interference is used.

C. Based on Triangulation
1) Angle of Arrival - AoA: In this method, the angle of
the arriving signals is determined and, using geometry, the
position can be determined. At least two stations in reach of
the mobile devices are a requirement for AoA. It is suitable
for indoor and outdoor positioning and it can measure in real
time. The estimation of the angle has an inaccuracy of only 2
degrees.17
AoA is not applicable without modification of the hardware,
but it returns good results. Special antennas are mandatory for
the determination of the location with the ”Angle of Arrival
method. These antennas must be able to measure the phaseshift of incoming signals. Therefore it is best to use directional
antennas or a multiple antenna array. The direction can be
determined with the TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival.) This
refers to the array antennas. When a signal hits the antenna at

Fig. 6.

Fig. 7. A special directional Wifi antenna determine the position with AoA.

the right angle, the TDoA is equal to zero. In all other cases
the signal hits the part of the antenna first that has the smallest
distance to the source of the signal. The time difference of the
receiving on the next part of the antenna is measured, and thus
the angle can be calculated.
With the triangulation technique it is possible to calculate
the position of the mobile device, due to the determination of
the incident angle on the receiving sensor of the station. From
the geometrical view, a line goes out in the calculated angle
from the antenna. If this is made with all the stations standing
at possession, an intersection originates. This is shown in
figure 8. As a reference value, the position, like with all
methods, must be confessed2 . This approach works well with
WiFi, but, as already mentioned, the hardware must be modified. As it would be extremely complicated to equip mobile
devices afterwards with an array of antennas, unfortunately
one cannot measure from which direction the signal from the
station comes. Therefore two topologies are omitted: terminalassisted and terminal based. Now the network-based topology
is the only one remaining. In practice it would be in such a
way that the stations tuple with mobile device ID, and that the
angle (or the TDoA data) is sent to a central server and this
calculates the positions.
Summary:
• Position determination with the intersection point of two

D. Based on Pattern recognition
1) Fingerprint Positioning: Fingerprinting, also called Location Patterning, uses a previously created database of signal
patterns, which need to be matched for positioning only.
Fingerprinting doesnt need modification of the hardware like,
for example, AoA. Furthermore, no time synchronisation is
necessary between the stations. Before a position can be determined, the entire area in which the positioning is supposed
to work must be recorded. This happens in Phase 1, the socalled calibration-phase, offline-phase or training-phase: The
area in which the positioning should later run, must be covered
with a pattern of recording points, called fingerprints. Step
by step, for every fingerprint there must be a measurement,
that includes the information about all stations and their
Received Signal Strength (RSS). Each fingerprint is a vector
R , associated with each element of a station.
The number of stations must be known and may be changed
only if the measurement is repeated from phase 1. The
collected data is stored in a database, called a radio map, so
that it can be retrieved later in phase 2.
That is the actual position determination phase. If a mobile
device should be located in the recorded area, then it measures
the signal strengths of all the current stations in range. It is the
actual position determination phase. If a mobile device should
be located in the recorded area, then it measures the RSS of
all the current stations in range. This data will be stored in
the comparative vector P. Now the euclidean distance between
P and the Rs on the radio map is calculated. The chance to
have chosen the right place is greatest where the Euclidean
distance is smallest. The disadvantage of this method is that
there must be a lot of complex preparation before the system
works.15
As we read in18 RSS strongly depends on line-of- sight,
so to improve the system every measurement should add
additional information about the direction. This takes longer
in phase 1 but delivers better results in phase 2. The table
shows an example of such a radio map.
Fingerprinting can be used with all three topologies. With
a network-based system every position is sent to the station
with mobile device beacons. As usual, with network-based
attempts, the software of the station must be customised, so
that the signal information can be extracted. If the information

is in the central server this can calculate the position. The
advantage with this topology is that devices that dont usually
have WiFi can also be located, for example: a wheelchair.
When a WiFi badge or a WiFi tag device, without any real
function except sending beacons, can be attached to this
device, this enables it to be found in the building anytime.
Later we will to talk about a company, called ekahau, that
uses this strategy. On the terminal-based approaches, there are
no great characteristics, so this topic is not taken up here again.
The functionality has already been explained in the preceding
chapter.
It is also interesting that the position of the station does not
need to be known. Only the position of the fingerprints must
be known, so that the type of coordinates used can be chosen.
It would, for example, be possible to use the geographic
coordinate system or our own coordinates of the building area.
Finger printing can be used indoors as well as outdoors like
this experiment shows.19

A. Hidden Markov Model
The hidden Markov model is a statistical model in which a
system can be modelled. It allows the system to integrate the
likelihood of a movement or positional change. To integrate
a hidden Markov model in a positioning system, a pattern
of nodes must be laid over the area, just like in fingerprinting. A node corresponds to a position and is connected bidirectionally to the edges of other nodes. At each of these
edges the likelihood for the transition to the next node is
attached. Mistakes like jumping through walls or floors can
therefore be reduced. We can see this used in a patent of
Ekahau.

VI. C OMMERCIAL SOLUIONS
A. Skyhook Wireless
Skyhook Wireless is a Company from Boston (USA) that
collect WiFi and Location Data. Their most famous customer
is Apple, who use the WiFi Location data to determine
positions without real GPS on the iPhone. They also offer
a SDK for WiFi Positioning that is available for free and
is especially valuable for mobile software developers. Like
Google, Skyhook Wireless has a collection of WiFi Stations
and positions them by using cars that go through the cities
and streets, which is called WarDrivering.9 Skyhook give an
accuracy of 10-20 meters, according to their website. To
get the best results they use XPS, the Hybrid Positioning
System. It uses GPS-, Cell Towers- and WiFi-measurements
for position determination. Due to this architecture, they are
able to provide a time to fix under 1 second. The database of
Skyhook Wireless includes the locations of over 250 million
WiFi access points and cellular towers.
B. Ekahau
2000 Ekahau was founded in Helsinki as a spin-off from
the University of Helsinki. Now the headquarters is in the
USA. Ekahau offers real time WiFi positioning systems for
companies, especially for hospitals. The system works both
indoors and outdoors. A whole range of WiFi enabled devices
are available. For example, small WiFi devices, like a watch,
for locating patients or others to send a help signal or to call
a nurse. The advantage of this WiFi positioning system is
that it can use the existing infrastructure of 802.11 a/b/g/n
stations. The Tracking algorithms is patented with 7 patents for
positioning. It uses the hidden markov model, signal strength
and signal value bit error rate.11 That allows Ekahau to offer
a good working positioning solution.

In January 2005, Navizon was founded. Just like Skyhook,
they collect data of WiFi access points, GSM Cells and the
associated GPS positions.

VII. C ONCLUSION
WiFi has become a widespreading technology, a technology
that has never been designed for localization. Nevertheless,
WiFi positioning performs well in comparison to other positioning technologies, and has the favourable advantage that it
is based on an existing infrastructure. First, it can be said that
all WiFi agreed methods are based on signal strength (except
AoA). Methods that are based on timing can not be realized
with WiFi. So the techniques ToA and TDoA were not agreed
by WiFi.
The technique best suited for each individual WiFi positioning is dependant on the environment. When indoors,
positioning fingerprinting delivers the best results. However,
it is also associated with a lot of effort. With a hidden
markov model the accuracy can be increased even further. The
Angle of Arrival is also a good opportunity. Unfortunately,
this requires special hardware and the localizations can only
be network-based. For indoor positioning CI or RSS gives
inaccurate values.
Outdoor WiFi has a smaller benefit, mostly because GPS
provides better results. However, there are outdoors areas,
where GPS can not perform. Then WiFi Positioning is a good
alternative. A further advantage is that WiFi is faster than GPS
at the beginning with finding the position. The GPS module
used in mobile devices usually needs a lot of power, and
by switching onto WiFi positioning it can use the already
switched on WiFi to determine its position. A system based
on CI is fast and easy to build up. RSS is also well suited
for outdoors and delivers even better results. AoA systems are
probably not profitable for larger areas, but they do give good
results. Fingerprinting can also be used outdoors. In this case,
the use of directional data will improve the accuracy of the
results.
