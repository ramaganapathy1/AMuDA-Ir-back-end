Abstract. Growing convergence among mobile computing devices and embedded technology sparks the development and deployment
of “context-aware” applications, where location is the most essential context. In this paper we present LANDMARC, a location sensing
prototype system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for locating objects inside buildings. The major advantage of
LANDMARC is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags. Based on experimental
analysis, we demonstrate that active RFID is a viable and cost-effective candidate for indoor location sensing. Although RFID is not
designed for indoor location sensing, we point out three major features that should be added to make RFID technologies competitive in this
new and growing market.
Keywords: location-aware computing, sensing network, RFID, signal strength, wireless communication

1. Introduction
The proliferation of wireless technologies, mobile computing
devices, and the Internet has fostered a growing interest in
location-aware systems and services. Many applications need
to know the physical location of objects. Over the years, many
systems have addressed the problem of automatic locationsensing. Triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are the
three principal techniques for automatic location-sensing [8].
One of the most well known location-based systems is the
Global Positioning System (GPS), a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into
orbit [6]. GPS is widely used to track moving objects located outdoors. However, GPS, as it is satellite dependent,
has an inherent problem of accurately determining the location of objects located inside buildings. Different approaches
have been proposed and tested for their effectiveness and utilities in order to achieve the ability to locate objects within
buildings.
The objective of our research is to develop an indoor
location-sensing system for various mobile commerce applications. Our goal is to implement a prototype indoor
location-sensing system using easily accessible wireless devices so that we can make use of existing infrastructures. At
present, there are several types of location-sensing systems,
each having their own strengths as well as limitations. Infrared, 802.11, ultrasonic, and RFID are some examples of
these systems. Section 2 will give a comparative overview
of these technologies and some related work. We are interested in using commodity off-the-shelf products. The results
of our comparative studies reveal that there are several advantages of the RFID technology. The no contact and non-line∗ Corresponding author.

of-sight nature of this technology are significant advantages
common among all types of RFID systems. All RF tags can
be read despite extreme environmental factors, such as snow,
fog, ice, paint, and other visually and environmentally challenging conditions. They can also work at remarkable speeds.
In some cases, tags can be read in less than a 100 milliseconds. The other advantages are their promising transmission
range and cost-effectiveness. Section 3 will give an overview
of the RFID technology.
Section 4 introduces LANDMARC, a location-sensing
prototype system based on RFID technologies. Since RFID
is not designed for location sensing, the purpose of our prototype indoor location-sensing system is to investigate whether
the RFID technology is suitable for locating objects with accuracy and cost-effectiveness. In section 5, we present the
experimental results of the LANDMARC system. Based on
the analysis of this study, suggestions are given for manufacturers of RFID products to use these products in alternative
and viable ways. Section 6 concludes the paper and describes
future research.
2. Related work
A number of wireless technologies have been used for indoor
location sensing.
Infrared. Active Badge, developed at Olivetti Research
Laboratory (now AT&T Cambridge), used diffuse infrared
technology [15] to realize indoor location positioning. The
line-of-sight requirement and short-range signal transmission
are two major limitations that suggest it to be less than effective in practice for indoor location sensing.
IEEE 802.11. RADAR is an RF based system for locating and tracking users inside buildings [3], using a standard

702

NI ET AL.

802.11 network adapter to measure signal strengths at multiple base stations positioned to provide overlapping coverage
in a given area. This system combines empirical measurements and signal propagation modeling in order to determine
user location thereby enabling location-aware services and
applications. The major strengths of this system are that it
is easy to set up, requires few base stations, and uses the same
infrastructure that provides general wireless networking in the
building. The difficulty is that the object being tracked must
be supported by a Wave LAN NIC, which may be impractical
on small or power constrained devices. In most cases to date,
the overall accuracy of the systems, using 802.11 technologies, is not as optimal as desired. For example, RADAR’s
implementation can place objects to within about 3 meters of
their actual position with 50 percent probability, while the signal strength lateration implementation has 4.3-meter accuracy
at the same probability level [8].
Figure 1. RFID system components.

Ultrasonic. The Cricket Location Support System [11] and
Active Bat location system [7] are two primary examples that
uses the ultrasonic technology. Normally, these systems use
an ultrasound time-of-flight measurement technique to provide location information. Most of them share a significant
advantage, which is the overall accuracy. Cricket, for example, can accurately delineate 4 × 4 square-feet regions within
a room while Active Bat can locate Bats to within 9 cm of
their true position for 95 percent of the measurements. However, the use of ultrasonic this way requires a great deal of
infrastructure in order to be highly effective and accurate,
yet the cost is so exorbitant that it is inaccessible to most
users.
RFID. One well-known location sensing systems using the
RFID technology is SpotON [10]. SpotON uses an aggregation algorithm for three dimensional location sensing based
on radio signal strength analysis. SpotON researchers have
designed and built hardware that will serve as object location tags. In the SpotON approach, objects are located by
homogenous sensor nodes without central control. SpotOn
tags use received radio signal strength information as a sensor measurement for estimating inter-tag distance. However,
a complete system has not been made available as of yet.
The above are popular technologies for indoor location
sensing. Some other technologies, such as ultra-wideband [1],
are also being investigated. The choice of technique and technology significantly affects the granularity and accuracy of
the location information. There are some other projects using the above technologies. Due to the lack of availability
of cost-effective indoor location sensing products, we have
tried both infrared and 802.11b products. Neither was satisfactory for the above reasons. We do not intend to build our
own devices due to cost constraint. We selected commercially
available RFID devices as our prototyping technology, which
is described below.

3. RFID technology and our first attempt
RFID (RF Identification) is a means of storing and retrieving data through electromagnetic transmission to an RF compatible integrated circuit and is now being seen as a radical
means of enhancing data handling processes [5]. An RFID
system has several basic components including a number of
RFID readers, RFID tags, and the communication between
them (figure 1).
The RFID reader can read data emitted from RFID tags.
RFID readers and tags use a defined radio frequency and protocol to transmit and receive data. RFID tags are categorized
as either passive or active. Passive RFID tags operate without
a battery. They reflect the RF signal transmitted to them from
a reader and add information by modulating the reflected signal. Passive tags are mainly used to replace the traditional barcode technology and are much lighter and less expensive than
active tags, offering a virtually unlimited operational lifetime.
However, their read ranges are very limited.
Active tags contain both a radio transceiver and a buttoncell battery to power the transceiver. Since there is an onboard
radio on the tag, active tags have more range than passive
tags. Active tags are ideally suited for the identification of
high-unit-value products moving through a tough assembly
process. They also offer the durability essential for permanent
identification of captive product carriers.
After looking into the specifications of different available
systems, we have chosen the Spider System manufactured by
RF Code [13] to implement the prototype framework. Their
active tags have a read range of 150 feet. If necessary, this
range can be increased to 1000 feet with the addition of a
special antenna. Figure 2 shows the RFID readers and tags
used in our system and their relative size compared with a US
quarter.
The range that can be achieved in an RFID system is essentially determined by [2]:

LANDMARC: INDOOR LOCATION SENSING USING ACTIVE RFID

Figure 2. The RFID reader and tag used in our prototype system.

• The power available at the reader/interrogator to communicate with the tag(s).
• The power available within the tag to respond.
• The environmental conditions and structures (the former
being more significant at higher frequencies including signal to noise ratio).
The field or wave delivered from an antenna extends into
the space surrounding it and its strength diminishes with respect to distance. The antenna design will determine the
shape of the field or propagation wave delivered, so that range
will also be influenced by the angle subtended between the tag
and antenna. In space free of any obstructions or absorption
mechanisms, the strength of the field reduces in inverse proportion to the square of the distance.
In our system, the RFID Reader’s operating frequency is
308 MHz. It also has an 802.11b interface to communicate with other machines. The detection range is 150 feet.
The reader provides digital control of read range via providing configuration software and API with 8 incremental read
ranges. Each reader can detect up to 500 tags in 7.5 seconds.
Each RFID tag is pre-programmed with a unique 7-character
ID for identification by readers. Its battery life is 3–5 years.
Tags send their unique ID signal in random with an average of
7.5 seconds. Note that the RFID reader has 8 different power
levels. Based on the signal strength received by the RFID
reader, the reader will report or ignore the received ID, where
power level 1 has the shortest range and level 8 has the longest
range.
Our first attempt is to install a number of readers as shown
in figure 3. Each reader has a pre-determined power level,
thus defining a certain range in which it can detect RFID tags.
By properly placing the readers in known locations, the whole
region can be divided into a number of sub-regions, where
each sub-region can be uniquely identified by the subset of
readers that cover that sub-region. Given an RFID tag, based
on the subset of readers that can detect it, we should be able to
associate that tag with a known sub-region. The accuracy of
this approach is then determined by the number of readers required, the placement of these readers, and the power level of
each reader. Such a nicely formulated optimization problem
turns out to be useless because the range in which a reader can
detect a tagged object is not just due to the power level (similar to signal strength). There are many factors that will affect
the range including both static obstructions and dynamic human movement. Due to these dynamic interferences, even a
static object could be reported in different sub-regions from

Figure 3. Placement of 9 readers with two different ranges and the subregions.

time to time. This is the same reason why approaches based
on the signal strength of 802.11b are not very useful.
4. LANDMARC approach
In order to increase accuracy without placing more readers,
the LANDARC (Location Identification based on Dynamic
Active RFID Calibration) system employs the idea of having
extra fixed location reference tags to help location calibration. These reference tags serve as reference points in the
system (like landmarks in our daily life). The proposed approach has three major advantages. First, there is no need for
a large number of expensive RFID readers. Instead we use
extra, cheaper RFID tags. Second, the environmental dynamics can easily be accommodated. Our approach helps offset
many environmental factors that contribute to the variations
in detected range because the reference tags are subject to
the same effect in the environment as the tags to be located.
Thus, we can dynamically update the reference information
for lookup based on the detected range from the reference
tags in real-time. Third, the location information is more accurate and reliable. The LANDMARC approach is more flexible and dynamic and can achieve much more accurate and
close to real-time location sensing. Obviously, the placement
of readers and reference tags is very important to the overall
accuracy of the system.
The LANDMARC approach does require signal strength
information from each tag to readers, if it is within the detectable range. However, the current RFID system does not
provide the signal strength of tags directly to readers. Readers only report the power level (1–8 in our system) of the tag
detected. We might do a preliminary measurement to know

704

which power level corresponds to what distance. However,
this may work only in free space. As indicated earlier, the
power level distribution is dynamic in a complicated indoor
environment. Thus, the physical distance cannot be computed
accurately by using power levels directly. We have to develop an algorithm to reflect the relations of signal strengths
by power levels.
4.1. System setup
The prototype environment consists of a sensing network that
helps the location tracking of mobile users/objects within certain granularity and accuracy, and a wireless network that
enables the communication between mobile devices and the
Internet. The sensing network primarily includes the RF readers and RF tags as mentioned earlier. The other major part of
the infrastructure is the wireless network that allows wireless
communication between mobile devices like PDAs and the
Internet. In addition, it also acts as a bridge between the sensing network and the other part of the system. As the reader
is equipped with the capability of communicating wirelessly
using IEEE 802.11b wireless network, all the tag information
gathered from readers is sent over to the supplied API sitting
on a specific server (the location server). This feature does not
have the problem of having a wire-connection to the readers,
thus reducing the possible restrictions of where the readers
could be placed. In addition, the wireless network will serve
as the fundamental framework of all the communications in
the infrastructure.
To be able to track an object’s location, the location information received from the RF readers has to be processed
before being useful. The following is a brief explanation of
some of the major configuration values in the API software:
• Device (RF readers) setup. Used for configuring the IP
addresses of the RF readers.
• Range. Used for specifying what range for tags is to be
scanned.
• Mode (exception versus continuous). (1) Exception mode:
The reader will report the tag when it is inside the detected
range while it will not report again until the reader realizes
the tag has gone out of range. (2) Continuous mode: The
reader will continuously report the tag ID as long as it was
in the configured range.
• Time/tag limit per log file. Used to configure how long and
how much tag events recorded before the API will start
a new log file. This is, in fact, somewhat critical to the
configuration in the sense of its effect on efficiency.
After the signal is received by the RF readers, the readers then report the information to “TagTracker Concentrator
LI” (a software program/API provided by RF Code, Inc.) via
a wired or wireless network. Moreover, the software also
acts as a central configuration interface for the RF readers.
For example, it can be used to adjust the detection range and
rate of the readers. After the information from the readers is
processed by the TagTracker Concentrator LI, the processed

location information can be buffered locally as a file on the
same machine or transmitted via a network socket (configurable in the API).
4.2. Methodology
Suppose we have n RF readers along with m tags as reference tags and u tracking tags as objects being tracked. The
readers are all configured with continuous mode (continuously reporting the tags that are within the specified range)
and a detection-rang of 1–8 (meaning the reader will scan
from range 1–8 and keep repeating the cycle with a rate
of 30 seconds per range). We define the Signal Strength
Vector of a tracking/moving tag as S = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn )
where Si denotes the signal strength of the tracking tag perceived on reader i, where i ∈ (1, n). For the reference
tags, we denote the corresponding Signal Strength vector as
θ = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn ) where θi denotes the signal strength.
We introduce the Euclidean distance in signal strengths. For
each individual
tracking tag p, where p ∈ (1, u), we define:

n
2
Ej =
i=1 (θi − Si ) where j ∈ (1, m), as the Euclidean
distance in signal strength between a tracking tag and a reference tag rj . Let E denotes the location relationship between
the reference tags and the tracking tag, i.e., the nearer reference tag to the tracking tag is supposed to have a smaller E
value. When there are m reference tags, a tracking tag has its
E vector as E = (E1 , E2 , . . . , Em ).
This algorithm is to find the unknown tracking tags’ nearest neighbors by comparing different E values. Since these E
values are only used to reflect the relations of the tags, we use
the reported value of the power level to take the place of the
value of signal strength in the equation.
There are three key issues we examine through the process
of locating the unknown tracking tags. The first issue is the
placement of the reference tags. Since the unknown tag is ultimately located in a cell surrounded by some reference tags,
the layout of reference tags may significantly affect the location accuracy of an algorithm. The second issue is to determine the number of reference tags in a reference cell that
are used in obtaining the most accurate approximate coordinate for each unknown tracking tag. For example, the simplest way to find the nearest reference tag to the tracking tag
is to use the coordinate of the reference tag with the smallest E value as the unknown tag’s coordinate. We call this as
1-nearest neighbor algorithm. Or, we can choose a tracking
tag’s two nearest neighbors and call it 2-nearest neighbor algorithm. When we use k nearest reference tags’ coordinates
to locate one unknown tag, we call it k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The unknown tracking tag’ coordinate (x, y) is obtained by:
(x, y) =

k


wi (xi , yi ),

i=1

where wi is the weighting factor to the ith neighboring reference tag. The choice of these weighting factors is another design parameter. Giving all k nearest neighbors with the same

weight (i.e., wi = 1/k) would make a lot of errors. Thus, the
third issue is to determine the weights assigned to different
neighbors. Intuitively, wi should depend on the E value of
each reference tag in the cell, i.e., wi is a function of the E
values of k-nearest neighbors. We have tried different ways to
define weight. Empirically, in LANDMARC, weight is given
by:
1/Ei2
.
wj = k
2
i=1 1/Ei
This approach provides the least error in most of the experiments, which means the reference tag with the smallest
E value has the largest weight. This may be explained by
the fact that the signal strength is inverse proportional to the
square of the distance. Note that our approach can be easily
extended to a 3-dimensional coordinate.
5. Experimental results and performance evaluation
We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate performance
of the positioning of the LANDMARC System. In the standard setup, we place 4 RF readers (n = 4) in our lab and 16
tags (m = 16) as reference tags while the other 8 tags (u = 8)
as objects being tracked, as illustrated in figure 4(a).
With the setup, the data are collected via the socket from
the TagTracker Concentrator LI in groups of a one-hour pe-

riod and the system will compute the coordinates of the tracking tags based on each group of data. To quantify how well
the LANDMARC system performs, the error distance is used
as the basis for the accuracy of the system. We define the location estimation error, e, to be the linear distance between
the tracking tag’s real coordinates (x0 , y0 ) and the computed
coordinates (x, y), given by

e = (x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 .
With the placement of the reference tags and the tracking
tags shown in figure 4 for over 48 hours, we keep collecting data of the power levels from 4 RF readers continuously.
Thus we obtain 48 groups of one-hour data. For each of 8
tracking tags per hour, the system computes the coordinates
of this tag by using the algorithm discussed in section 4. We
then compute the location error e for each tracking tag. Thus,
we have 48 groups of 8e values. We may examine the location accuracy by analyzing the distribution of these e values
under different conditions. Note that we have repeated the
experiments many times to avoid statistical errors.
5.1. Effect of the number of nearest neighbors
One of the key issues is to find a best k value in the algorithm. We choose different k values as k = 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 and compute the coordinates of the tracking tags, respec-

tively. Figure 5 shows the results of using different k values
in the formula.
As shown in figure 5, k = 4 works the best and the positioning accuracy does not improve as the k value further increases. Keeping the same placement, we repeat the process
for another 48 hours. Though the positioning error distribution changes, k = 4 still gives the best location information.
In fact, in all the later experiments except on a few occasions
that k = 3 and k = 5 worked better, in most cases k = 4 is the
best choice. Hence, we set 4 as the value of k in our formula
in the following experiments.
Based on the statistics, it can be seen that the 50 percentile
has an error distance of around 1 meter while the maximum
error distances are less than 2 meters. This is very promising
because the 50 percentile of the RADAR project is around
2.37–2.65 m and its 90 percentile is around 5.93–5.97 m [4].
5.2. Influence of the environmental factors
In order to see how well the LANDMARC approach works
in different environments, we collect 10 groups of data from
midnight to early morning (during which time there is little
movement) and another 10 groups of data from 10:00 AM
to 3:00 PM (at which time varying level of activities that
would result in variations in transmission of the tags). Figure 6 shows the comparison.
We know that during the daytime, the lab is very busy with
many people so there is more interference than at night. From
the results, we do not see much difference in the overall accuracy. This shows that our reference tag approach can successfully offset the dynamics of interference.
As the positions of tracking tags in the real world would
be unpredictable, we change the placements of tracking tags
randomly and expect the distribution of e could be changed

but the accuracy of the system should be at the same level.
We change the placement of the tracking tags as shown in
figure 4(b) with the reference tags’ placement unchanged and
repeat the process.
Figure 7 is the comparison of the results between the two
tracking tag placements shown in figure 4. As we expected,
the distribution is changed but the overall accuracy is at the
same level. Figures 6 and 7 show that the approach of using
reference tags effectively helps offset some of the environmental factors that contribute to the variations in a detected
range. Since the reference tags are subject to the same effect
in the environment as the tags to be located, we can dynamically update the reference information for lookup, based on
the detected range from the reference tags in real-time.
5.3. Effect of the number of readers
One of the problems of using RF to locate objects is the inconsistency of the signal strength reception. This can primarily
be due to the environment and the device itself. In most cases,
the environmental factors always have the most impact on the
accuracy and maximum detectable range. These include issues like furniture placement, people’s movement, and so on.
Besides, non-line of sight (NLOS) is another source of reducing the location sensing accuracy. Even NLOS does not
prohibit RF transmission as that of infrared, it does create the
multi-path problem, meaning the signal can possibly take different paths to reach the receiver and result in interference
among the received signals.
To better deal with the problem, we can use more RF readers to improve the accuracy. With more RF readers, a better
decision can be made for location sensing because more data
can be gathered by having extra readers to do the sensing as
shown in figure 8. However, the RF readers are usually quite
expensive so placing more readers means extra costs for the

whole system. Due to budget constraints, we have only four
RF readers. Adding more readers may not necessary significantly increase the accuracy. It does increase the processing
overhead.
5.4. Effect of placement of reference tags
Intuitively, placement of reference tags should have an effect
on the measurement accuracy. Consider the two configurations shown in figure 9.
In the case of figure 9(a), where there is not any obstacle,
it is probable that the system can easily find the tracking tag’s
four nearest neighbors which are tags e, f , h, i by comparing the reported signal strengths and Ef could be the smallest
in this tracking tag’s E vector. Thus, the tracking tag could
be located among the four reference tags. However, sometimes the environment could be more complicated. Suppose
there is a partition (or sometimes even a person standing like
the partition) as shown in figure 9(b). Under these circumstances, it is possible that the reception of the signal strength
from the reference tag f is influenced by the partition (or the
unexpected people). Consequently, the readers will report a
weaker signal strength from tag f so that tag f could fail to
be included in the four neighbors of the tracking tag. Instead,
tag k may become one of the four reported nearest neighbors
to the tracking tag as shown in figure 9(b). Using e, h, i, k as
the four reported neighbors, the position of the tracking tag is
likely to be computed as indicated in figure 9(b). Thus, more
error occurs.
Things will change if we place more reference tags as illustrated in figure 10. Around the tracking tag, now we have

placed more reference tags (the green ones in the figure). Together with the tag i, tags m, n, o could be included in the
four reported nearest neighbors of the tracking tag. Thus, better location information will be provided.

LANDMARC: INDOOR LOCATION SENSING USING ACTIVE RFID

In our next experiment, we place all of the reference tags
with a higher density as shown in figure 11. In the first 48
hours we keep the original positions of all the tracking tags
unchanged (case Near 1 in figure 11). In the next 48 hours
we move the positions of the tracking tags as indicated in the
case of Near 2 in figure 11.
It can be seen in figure 12 that the accuracy of the LANDMARC System is improved with a higher reference tag density, as we have discussed. However, the improvement is not
as great as we expected. We will discuss this point later.
Figure 13 shows two configurations of a lower reference
tag density. The corresponding distribution of error distance
is shown in figure 14. As expected, the accuracy has dropped
quite significantly.
It is obvious that the accuracy of the LANDMARC approach decreases greatly with a lower density of reference
tags. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and the
number of reference tags. Conceivably, we can improve the
accuracy of the LANDMARC System by placing as many reference tags as we can, for example, even in every cubic square
centimeter of the space where we want to locate objects. This
does not make much sense due to the increased complexity,
overheads, inherent device error, and measurement error. The
experimental results have indicated that the LANDMARC approach works well. Using 4 RF readers in our lab, we roughly
need one reference tag per square meter to accurately locate
the objects within the error distance such that the worst error is 2 meters and the average is about 1 meter. We believe
that the accuracy can be greatly improved if RFID vendors
can make some design changes to be discussed in the next
section.

6. Conclusions and future research
This paper has presented a prototype indoor location sensing
system using active RFID. Active RFID is not designed for
accurate indoor location sensing. A detection range of 150
feet does not provide needed accuracy for many practical applications. The proposed LANDMARC approach does show
that active RFID is a viable cost-effective candidate for accurate indoor location sensing. However, there are three problems that RFID vendors have to overcome in order to compete
in a new and growing market.
The first problem is that none of the currently available
RFID products provides the signal strength of tags directly.
Instead, the reader reports “detectable” or “not detectable” in
a given range. This forces LANDMARC to spend approximately one minute each time to scan the 8 discrete power
levels and to estimate the signal strength of tags. By sending
the signal strength information directly from readers, it will
not only eliminate unnecessary processing time, but also reduce errors. This feature can easily be added as readers do
have the signal strength information from tags.
The second problem is the long latency between a tracking
tag being physically placed to its location being computed by
the location server. There are two factors contributing to this

709

long latency. One is the scanning time of different power levels as indicated above. This factor can be eliminated by sending the signal strength directly. The second factor is the time
interval of emitting two consecutive IDs from an active tag.
Our product has an average interval of 7.5 seconds in order to
avoid signal collision for handling up to 500 tags. Depending
on the total number of tags expected in a detectable area, this
time interval can be further reduced. RFID vendors should
provide a mechanism to allow users to reconfigure the time
interval.
The third problem is the variation of the behavior of tags.
When employing the LANDMARC approach, the basic assumption is that all tags have roughly the same signal strength
in emitting the RF signal. In our experiments we found that
the power level detected by the same reader from two tags in
an identical location may be different. A possible explanation
for the difference may be due to the variation of the chips and
circuits, as well as batteries. In fact, before our experiments,
we had conducted a series of pre-tests to classify tags based
on their signal strength. Repeated experiments are needed to
classify these tags due to the potential signal collision causing
a detectable tag not detectable. This is another factor decreasing the accuracy of the system.
If all the above problems can be overcome, the accuracy
and latency will be greatly improved. However, the error
due to the dynamics of the environment can hardly be alleviated. A major advantage of LANDMARC is to help offset
some of the environmental factors that contribute to the variation of accuracy of locating objects. However, the dynamic
environment is still one of the main reasons for increasing
measurement errors, as we can never guarantee all the nearest neighbors and the tracking tag itself are always influenced
equally. Sometimes a person standing in front of a tracking
tag may greatly increase the error distance of locating this tag
and such an error is often unpredictable.
In our experiments all reference tags are organized in a grid
array. This may explain the reason of using 4 nearest neighbors. The influence of having other shapes of reference tags
to the selection of the number of nearest neighbors will be investigated. In the practical application of LANDMARC, the
placement of reference tags may be dependent on the configuration and layout of the environment. Our methodology can
easily be applied to 3D coordinates. In this case, the number
of nearest neighbors to be considered is likely to be increased
from 4 to 8. The accuracy of the 3D case will also be studied.
We are also investigating the use of Bluetooth for location
sensing based on the same methodology. Each Bluetooth device emits a 48-bit unique ID, but with a shorter range of up
to 10 meters. As Bluetooth, like RFID, is not designed for
location sensing, it also has some inherent problems. The implementation of a location-sensing system based on Bluetooth
is currently taking place in our lab.
